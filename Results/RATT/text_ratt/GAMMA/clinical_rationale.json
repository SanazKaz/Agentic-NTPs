GSEC first cuts APP-CTF at the epsilon-cleavage site located close to the inner leaflet of the membrane. \nThis cleavage event produces either A\u03b248 or A\u03b249 and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). The membrane-retained A\u03b248 or A\u03b249 is then further processed by GSEC in a continuous cascade of proteolytical events at every third of fourth amino acid, where the N-terminal product of each reaction becomes the substrate for the next GSEC cleavage event.\nAccordingly, GSEC processes APP-CTF along two main product lines, A\u03b249 \u2192 46 \u2192 43 \u2192 40 \u2192 37\u2026 and A\u03b248 \u2192 45 \u2192 42 \u2192 38\u2026, respectively. During this processing cascade, A\u03b243 and shorter A\u03b2 peptides stochastically escape further processing by GSEC and are released into the extracellular space. \nAs a result, A\u03b2 peptides varying from 30 to 43 amino acids in length are secreted into the extracellular space. Among all secreted A\u03b2, A\u03b240 is the most abundant in human CSF, followed by A\u03b238, A\u03b242, and A\u03b237. In cognitively normal individuals, A\u03b242 and A\u03b243 represent a smaller portion of the total secreted A\u03b2.\nThese longer forms of A\u03b2 seed the formation of A\u03b2-amyloid aggregates, a key step in the formation of amyloid plaques (Veugelen et al., 2016), as illustrated in Figure 1. A\u03b242, which is produced in higher amounts than A\u03b243, is the most abundant A\u03b2 in amyloid plaques (Welander et al., 2009).\n \n\n ### Clinical target rationale:\n    - How relevant is the target location to the disease biology?\n    - How is the target expression altered in human disease?\n    - How is the target involved in the physiological process relevant to the disease?\n    - Which phenotypes and genotypes were identified for the target?\n    - How is the genetic link between the target and the disease?\n    - Describe the evidence provided in clinics or by tools acting on the pathway where the target is involved.\n    - Which kind of target modulation is required to treat the disease?

output_cot: ### Clinical Target Rationale for Gamma Secretase in Alzheimer's Disease\n\n#### Target Location Relevance\nGamma secretase is a critical enzyme in the amyloidogenic pathway, responsible for the final cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides. The accumulation of A\u03b2, particularly A\u03b242, is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, leading to amyloid plaque formation in the brain. Thus, the localization and function of gamma secretase in the membrane of neurons are highly relevant to the disease biology of AD.\n\n#### Target Expression Alteration in Disease\nIn Alzheimer's disease, the expression and activity of gamma secretase can be altered due to various factors, including genetic mutations in its subunits (e.g., presenilin-1 and presenilin-2) and changes in the expression of APP. These alterations can lead to increased production of pathogenic A\u03b2 peptides, particularly A\u03b242, contributing to the neurodegenerative process observed in AD (Selkoe, 2001).\n\n#### Involvement in Physiological Processes\nGamma secretase plays a vital role in the physiological processing of APP, which is essential for normal neuronal function and signaling. It also processes other type I membrane proteins, influencing various cellular pathways, including those involved in synaptic function and cell survival. Dysregulation of gamma secretase activity can disrupt these processes, leading to synaptic loss and neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer's disease (De Strooper & Karran, 2016).\n\n#### Phenotypes and Genotypes Identified\nGenetic studies have identified several mutations in the presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) that enhance gamma secretase activity, leading to increased production of A\u03b242. These mutations are associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, highlighting a direct link between altered gamma secretase function and AD phenotypes (Levy-Lahad et al., 1995).\n\n#### Genetic Link to Disease\nThe genetic link between gamma secretase and Alzheimer's disease is underscored by the presence of mutations in presenilin genes that cause familial forms of AD. These mutations result in altered enzymatic activity of gamma secretase, leading to an imbalance in A\u03b2 production, favoring the formation of the more toxic A\u03b242 peptide (Sherrington et al., 1995).\n\n#### Clinical Evidence and Tools\nClinical evidence supporting the role of gamma secretase in Alzheimer\u2019s disease includes the observation of increased A\u03b2 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients, correlating with the degree of cognitive impairment. Additionally, gamma secretase inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials, showing potential in reducing A\u03b2 levels, although they have been associated with adverse effects due to the enzyme's role in processing other substrates (Salloway et al., 2014).\n\n#### Required Target Modulation\nTo effectively treat Alzheimer's disease, modulation of gamma secretase activity is required to reduce the production of pathogenic A\u03b2 peptides, particularly A\u03b242, while preserving its physiological functions. Strategies may include the development of selective gamma secretase modulators that can decrease A\u03b242 generation without completely inhibiting the enzyme, thereby minimizing side effects (Karran & De Strooper, 2016).\n\n### References\n- De Strooper, M. & Karran, E.

The cleavage of APP by GSEC leads to the generation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The production of A\u03b2, particularly the aggregation-prone A\u03b242 variant, is a key feature of AD pathology, resulting in amyloid plaque formation (Yang et al., 2024). \n\n### Alteration of Target Expression in Human Disease\nIn Alzheimer's disease, mutations in the presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2), which are critical components of the GSEC complex, lead to altered gamma secretase activity. These mutations are associated with an increased production of A\u03b242 over A\u03b240, thereby promoting amyloid plaque formation. Over 200 mutations in presenilin have been linked to familial AD, with approximately 90% of familial cases attributed to these genetic alterations (Yang et al., 2024). \n\n### Involvement of Target in Physiological Processes Relevant to Disease\nGSEC is essential not only for APP processing but also for the cleavage of other substrates involved in critical cellular processes, such as Notch signaling. The dysregulation of GSEC activity due to presenilin mutations disrupts these processes, contributing to synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and ultimately neuronal death, which are hallmarks of AD (Yang et al., 2024). \n\n### Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target\nMutations in presenilin, particularly PSEN1, lead to distinct phenotypes of early-onset familial AD, characterized by cognitive decline and the presence of amyloid plaques. The genetic variations in presenilin have been shown to correlate with the severity and onset of AD symptoms, reinforcing the significance of this target in disease pathology (Yang et al., 2024).\n\n### Genetic Link Between Target and Disease\nThe genetic link between presenilin and Alzheimer's disease is well-established, with numerous studies documenting how mutations in PSEN1 and PSEN2 lead to altered gamma secretase function. This disruption results in an imbalance in A\u03b2 production, favoring the formation of the more toxic A\u03b242 peptide, which is directly implicated in the development of amyloid plaques (Yang et al., 2024). \n\n### Evidence from Clinical Studies and Tools\nClinical trials targeting gamma secretase have faced challenges, with drugs such as semagacestat and avagacestat being discontinued due to adverse effects, including cognitive decline. However, ongoing research continues to explore the potential of refining GSEC inhibitors and developing personalized medicine approaches based on specific presenilin mutations (Yang et al., 2024). The use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology also shows promise in selectively disrupting PSEN1 mutations, further supporting the genetic link to AD (Yang et al., 2024).\n\n### Required Target Modulation for Treatment\nEffective treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease will require careful modulation of gamma secretase activity. The goal is to reduce the production of toxic A\u03b2 peptides while preserving the essential functions of GSEC in processing other substrates. This balance is critical to avoid unintended consequences that could arise from complete inhibition of gamma secretase activity (Yang et al., 2024). \n\n
