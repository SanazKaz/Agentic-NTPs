# Challenges for the drug discovery program related to Gamma Secretase as a target in Alzheimer's Disease      **Given target:** Gamma secretase      **Given disease:** Alzheimer's disease      **Given mode of action:** Gamma secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex that cleaves type I transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to the generation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides. ##Context:  A\u03b2 is a family of secreted peptides generated from the sequential cleavages of the type 1 membrane protein APP by beta-secretase (BACE) and gamma-secretase (GSEC), respectively.   BACE cleaves APP in the luminal domain, releasing the N-terminal soluble APP\u03b2 domain and leaving the C-terminal fragment, APP-CTF, which remains in the membrane.   Subsequently, the APP-CTF is recruited to GSEC, a complex comprising four subunits, including PS, which harbors the active site. GSEC first cuts APP-CTF at the epsilon-cleavage site located close to the inner leaflet of the membrane.   This cleavage event produces either A\u03b248 or A\u03b249 and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). The membrane-retained A\u03b248 or A\u03b249 is then further processed by GSEC in a continuous cascade of proteolytical events at every third of fourth amino acid, where the N-terminal product of each reaction becomes the substrate for the next GSEC cleavage event.  Accordingly, GSEC processes APP-CTF along two main product lines, A\u03b249 \u2192 46 \u2192 43 \u2192 40 \u2192 37\u2026 and A\u03b248 \u2192 45 \u2192 42 \u2192 38\u2026, respectively. During this processing cascade, A\u03b243 and shorter A\u03b2 peptides stochastically escape further processing by GSEC and are released into the extracellular space.   As a result, A\u03b2 peptides varying from 30 to 43 amino acids in length are secreted into the extracellular space. Among all secreted A\u03b2, A\u03b240 is the most abundant in human CSF, followed by A\u03b238, A\u03b242, and A\u03b237. In cognitively normal individuals, A\u03b242 and A\u03b243 represent a smaller portion of the total secreted A\u03b2.  These longer forms of A\u03b2 seed the formation of A\u03b2-amyloid aggregates, a key step in the formation of amyloid plaques (Veugelen et al., 2016), as illustrated in Figure 1. A\u03b242, which is produced in higher amounts than A\u03b243, is the most abundant A\u03b2 in amyloid plaques (Welander et al., 2009). ### Challenges:  - Check the following idea for details on small molecule compounds: Developing small molecule modulators or inhibitors of gamma secretase for Alzheimer's disease treatment.  - Is a 'information driven approach' (IDA) strategy based on available small molecules possible?  - Which small molecular modulators of the target known?  - Which inhibitors, antagonists, agonists, negative allosteric modulators (NAM), positive allosteric modulators (PAM) are required for target modulation in the given disease?   - Which patients would respond the therapy?  - Is the proposed mode of action on the target desirable and commercially viable in a clinical setting?  - What are advantages and disadvantages of different therapeutic modalities (antibodies, small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides, PROTACs, molecular glue, peptide macrocycles, and so on) for tackling the target? - Alternative indications:  - Describe alternative indication for modulators of the target and explain why.

### Challenges for Drug Discovery Program Related to Gamma Secretase in Alzheimer's Disease 
#### 1. Development of Small Molecule Modulators  Developing small molecule modulators or inhibitors of gamma secretase presents several challenges. The complexity of the gamma secretase complex, which consists of multiple subunits (including presenilin, nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2), makes it difficult to design specific small molecules that selectively modulate its activity without affecting other proteolytic processes. Additionally, the requirement for precise modulation of A\u03b2 levels is critical; too much inhibition may lead to adverse effects due to the blockade of other essential substrates processed by gamma secretase.
#### 2. Information-Driven Approach (IDA) Strategy  An information-driven approach (IDA) strategy based on available small molecules is feasible. Utilizing structure-activity relationship (SAR) data from existing gamma secretase inhibitors can guide the design of new compounds. Computational modeling and docking studies can also help identify potential binding sites and optimize lead compounds. However, the challenge remains in balancing efficacy against A\u03b2 production while minimizing off-target effects.
#### 3. Known Small Molecular Modulators  Several small molecular modulators of gamma secretase have been identified, including:  - **Semagacestat**: A gamma secretase inhibitor that failed in clinical trials due to adverse effects.  - **Begacestat**: Another inhibitor that showed promise but encountered similar issues in clinical settings.  - **ELND006**: A selective gamma secretase modulator that aimed to lower A\u03b242 levels selectively without affecting other substrates significantly.
#### 4. Types of Modulators Required  For effective target modulation in Alzheimer's disease, various types of modulators are required:  - **Inhibitors**: To reduce A\u03b2 production, though they must be carefully dosed to avoid side effects.  - **Positive Allosteric Modulators (PAMs)**: To enhance the processing of APP in a manner that favors non-amyloidogenic pathways.  - **Negative Allosteric Modulators (NAMs)**: To prevent overactivation of the gamma secretase complex, potentially reducing the production of harmful A\u03b242.
#### 5. Patient Response to Therapy  Patients who may respond best to gamma secretase modulation are likely those with early-stage Alzheimer's disease, where A\u03b2 aggregation is just beginning. Genetic factors, such as mutations in the APP or presenilin genes, may also influence responsiveness. Biomarkers indicating elevated levels of A\u03b242 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could help identify suitable candidates for therapy.
#### 6. Commercial Viability and Desirability of Mode of Action  The proposed mode of action involving modulation of gamma secretase is commercially viable if it can demonstrate a favorable risk-benefit profile in clinical trials. Given the central role of A\u03b2 in Alzheimer's pathology, successful modulation could lead to significant market potential. However, the history of failed gamma secretase inhibitors raises concerns about safety and efficacy that must be addressed in future developments.

#### 7. Advantages and Disadvantages of Therapeutic Modalities
- **Antibodies**: High specificity and potential for targeted delivery but may have limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).  
- **Small Molecules**: Easier to deliver across the BBB and can be orally administered, but specificity and off-target effects are concerns.
- **Antisense Oligonucleotides**: Can effectively reduce target protein levels, but delivery to the CNS remains challenging.
- **PROTACs**: Offer the potential for targeted degradation of proteins but are still in early development stages.
- **Molecular Glue**: May enhance degradation of specific proteins but require careful design to avoid off-target effects.
- **Peptide Macrocycles**: Potentially high specificity and affinity but may face challenges in delivery and stability.

#### 8. Alternative Indications for Modulators  Alternative indications for gamma secretase modulators could include other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by protein aggregation, such as Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) or Huntington's disease, where similar pathways involving amyloidogenic processing may be implicated. Additionally, modulation of gamma secretase may have therapeutic potential in certain cancers where aberrant Notch signaling (a pathway also regulated by gamma secretase) plays a role in tumorigenesis.

Accessed 2024.** ### Challenges for the Drug Discovery Program Related to Gamma Secretase as a Target in Alzheimer's Disease **Developing Small Molecule Modulators or Inhibitors of Gamma Secretase** Developing small molecule modulators or inhibitors of gamma secretase (GSEC) presents significant challenges due to the complex nature of this multi-subunit protease involved in the production of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides. While gamma secretase inhibitors (GSIs) have shown the ability to reduce A\u03b2 production, their nonselective inhibition of Notch signaling has led to severe side effects, including impaired cognition and increased cancer risk (Hur, 2022). This necessitates the development of more selective gamma secretase modulators (GSMs) that can alter the processing of APP without fully inhibiting GSEC activity, thereby sparing Notch processing and potentially reducing adverse effects (Luo and Li, 2022).**Information Driven Approach (IDA) Strategy** An information-driven approach (IDA) based on available small molecules is indeed possible and could be beneficial in identifying more selective modulators. This strategy would involve leveraging high-resolution structural studies of gamma secretase to inform the design of small molecules that can selectively modulate its activity (Luo and Li, 2022). Understanding the binding sites and interactions within the gamma secretase complex is crucial for developing effective GSMs that can enhance the production of shorter, less toxic A\u03b2 peptides while minimizing the formation of longer, aggregation-prone forms (Hur, 2022). **Known Small Molecular Modulators** Several small molecular modulators of gamma secretase have been identified, including NSAID-derived GSMs and more recent non-NSAID-derived compounds. First-generation GSMs, such as ibuprofen and indomethacin, have demonstrated efficacy in lowering A\u03b242 levels without affecting Notch cleavage (Luo and Li, 2022). The second-generation GSMs, such as E2012, have also shown promise in clinical settings by selectively reducing A\u03b2 levels (Luo and Li, 2022). However, challenges remain in improving their potency and brain penetration while mitigating side effects. **Required Inhibitors and Modulators for Target Modulation** To effectively modulate gamma secretase in Alzheimer's disease, a combination of inhibitors, antagonists, and allosteric modulators will be necessary. Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) may enhance GSEC's carboxypeptidase-like activity, thus promoting the generation of shorter A\u03b2 peptides. Conversely, negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) could be designed to inhibit the production of longer, more pathogenic A\u03b2 forms (Svedru\u017ei\u0107 et al., 2023). The development of competitive inhibitors that mimic protective genetic mutations, such as the A673T mutation, could also provide a novel therapeutic strategy (Svedru\u017ei\u0107 et al., 2023). **Patient Response to Therapy** Patients who would likely respond to therapy targeting gamma secretase modulation include those in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, particularly those with elevated amyloid levels as indicated by PET imaging. Identifying amyloid-positive individuals will be crucial for the effective application of GSMs and other A\u03b2-targeted therapies (Luo and Li, 2022). Furthermore, understanding the genetic and biochemical profiles of patients may help tailor treatments to enhance efficacy. **Desirability and Commercial Viability of the Mode of Action** The proposed mode of action for gamma secretase modulation is both desirable and commercially viable in a clinical setting. By selectively altering the processing of APP to favor the production of shorter, less toxic A\u03b2 peptides, GSMs could potentially mitigate the neurotoxic effects associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease while minimizing adverse effects related to Notch signaling inhibition (Hur, 2022). This approach aligns well with the current trend toward precision medicine, where therapies are tailored to the specific pathophysiological mechanisms of individual patients. **Advantages and Disadvantages of Different Therapeutic Modalities** Various therapeutic modalities present distinct advantages and disadvantages in targeting gamma secretase.  - **Antibodies**: While they can provide high specificity and efficacy, their large size may limit brain penetration and necessitate parenteral administration.      - **Small Molecules**: These offer the potential for oral administration and better brain penetration, but challenges in selectivity and off-target effects remain significant (Luo and Li, 2022). - **Antisense Oligonucleotides**: These can specifically target mRNA, potentially reducing A\u03b2 production at the transcriptional level, but delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) is a critical hurdle. - **PROTACs and Molecular Glue**: These emerging modalities offer innovative approaches to target protein degradation, which may provide a way to selectively eliminate pathological proteins, including those involved in A\u03b2 aggregation. - **Peptide Macrocycles**: These can offer high specificity and affinity but may face challenges in terms of stability and bioavailability. In conclusion, while the development of gamma secretase modulators for Alzheimer's disease is fraught with challenges, the potential for more selective and effective therapies remains promising. Ongoing research into the structural biology of gamma secretase and the mechanistic understanding of A\u03b2 production will be vital in overcoming these hurdles and advancing therapeutic options for patients.
