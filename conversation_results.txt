**Working hypothesis:**

The working hypothesis for targeting gamma-secretase (GSEC) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is that the inhibition of GSEC will reduce the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly the more toxic forms such as Aβ42 and Aβ43, thereby mitigating the formation of amyloid plaques, which are a hallmark of AD pathology. Given the established role of GSEC in the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), inhibiting this enzyme could lead to a decrease in the overall burden of Aβ in the brain, potentially slowing the progression of cognitive decline associated with AD.

**Unmet medical need:**

Alzheimer's disease represents a significant unmet medical need, with millions of individuals affected globally. Current therapeutic options are limited and primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. The need for disease-modifying therapies that can effectively reduce amyloid plaque formation and improve cognitive function is critical, as existing treatments do not halt or reverse the progression of the disease.

**Suitability for combination therapy:**

Targeting GSEC may be suitable for combination therapy with other AD treatments, such as anti-amyloid antibodies or tau-targeting therapies. Combining GSEC inhibitors with other modalities could provide a multifaceted approach to AD, addressing multiple aspects of the disease pathology simultaneously and potentially enhancing overall therapeutic efficacy.

**Predictive biomarkers:**

Several predictive biomarkers exist that are relevant to the modulation of GSEC in AD. These include:

1. **Amyloid PET Imaging:** This imaging technique allows for the visualization of amyloid plaque burden in the brain, providing a direct measure of Aβ accumulation.
   
2. **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Aβ Levels:** The concentration of Aβ peptides, particularly Aβ42, in CSF can serve as a biomarker for AD pathology and response to GSEC inhibition.

3. **Neurodegeneration Biomarkers:** Markers such as total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in CSF can indicate neurodegeneration and may correlate with the efficacy of GSEC inhibitors.

**Clinical target rationale:**

1. **Relevance of target location to disease biology:** GSEC is located in the membrane of neurons and glial cells, where it plays a crucial role in the processing of APP. The production of Aβ peptides occurs at the synaptic level, making GSEC a relevant target for modulating synaptic health and preventing neurodegeneration.

2. **Altered target expression in human disease:** Studies have shown that GSEC activity is upregulated in the brains of AD patients, leading to increased production of toxic Aβ forms. This alteration in GSEC expression and activity is directly linked to the pathogenesis of AD.

3. **Physiological processes relevant to the disease:** GSEC is involved in the normal processing of APP, which has roles in synaptic function and neuronal survival. Dysregulation of this process contributes to the accumulation of toxic Aβ, leading to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration.

4. **Phenotypes and genotypes identified for the target:** Genetic variants in the genes encoding GSEC components, such as presenilin (PSEN1 and PSEN2), have been associated with familial forms of AD. These mutations lead to altered GSEC activity and increased production of pathogenic Aβ peptides.

5. **Genetic link between target and disease:** Mutations in presenilin genes are the most common cause of early-onset familial AD, providing a strong genetic link between GSEC and the disease. Additionally, polymorphisms in the APOE gene, a major risk factor for late-onset AD, may also influence GSEC activity and Aβ production.

6. **Clinical evidence and tools:** Clinical trials targeting GSEC have shown that modulation of this pathway can lead to changes in Aβ levels in CSF and brain imaging. For example, the use of GSEC inhibitors has demonstrated reductions in Aβ42 levels, correlating with clinical outcomes in AD patients.

7. **Required target modulation:** To treat AD effectively, a balanced modulation of GSEC is required, where the production of toxic Aβ forms is reduced without completely abolishing the normal physiological functions of APP processing.

**Challenges for the drug discovery program:**

1. **Selectivity and specificity:** Developing GSEC inhibitors that selectively target the cleavage of APP without affecting other substrates is a significant challenge, as GSEC also processes other important proteins.

2. **Side effects:** Inhibition of GSEC may lead to unintended consequences, such as the accumulation of other substrates, which could result in adverse effects.

3. **Patient heterogeneity:** The genetic and phenotypic diversity among AD patients may affect the response to GSEC inhibitors, complicating treatment strategies.

**Information-driven approach (IDA):**

1. **Known small molecular modulators:** Several small molecule inhibitors of GSEC have been identified, including compounds like semagacestat and avagacestat, which have been tested in clinical trials.

2. **Required modulators:** A combination of inhibitors, antagonists, and potentially positive allosteric modulators may be required to achieve the desired modulation of GSEC activity while minimizing side effects.

3. **Patient response:** Patients with elevated Aβ levels or specific genetic backgrounds (e.g., presenilin mutations) may be more likely to respond to GSEC inhibitors.

4. **Desirability and commercial viability:** The proposed mode of action targeting GSEC is desirable, as it addresses a central mechanism in AD pathology. However, commercial viability will depend on the safety and efficacy profiles of the developed compounds.

5. **Therapeutic modalities:** Each therapeutic modality has its advantages and disadvantages. Antibodies may offer high specificity but may not penetrate the blood-brain barrier effectively. Small molecules can be designed for better brain penetration but may have off-target effects. Antisense oligonucleotides and PROTACs offer novel approaches but require careful consideration of delivery mechanisms.

**Alternative indications:**

Modulators of GSEC may have potential in other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by protein aggregation, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and certain forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The commonality of Aβ-like peptide aggregation in these conditions suggests that GSEC modulation could be beneficial in reducing toxic peptide accumulation and improving neuronal health in these diseases.
