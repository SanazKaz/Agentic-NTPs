    "    Given target: Gamma secretase\n",
    "    Given disease: Alzheimer's disease\n",
    "    Given mode of action: Gamma secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex that cleaves type I transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Context:\n",
    "     Aβ is a family of secreted peptides generated from the sequential cleavages of the type 1 membrane protein APP by beta-secretase (BACE) and gamma-secretase (GSEC), respectively. \n",
    "     BACE cleaves APP in the luminal domain, releasing the N-terminal soluble APPβ domain and leaving the C-terminal fragment, APP-CTF, which remains in the membrane. \n",
    "     Subsequently, the APP-CTF is recruited to GSEC, a complex comprising four subunits, including PS, which harbors the active site. \n",
    "     GSEC first cuts APP-CTF at the epsilon-cleavage site located close to the inner leaflet of the membrane. This cleavage event produces either Aβ48 or Aβ49 and the APP intracellular domain (AICD).\n",
    "    The membrane-retained Aβ48 or Aβ49 is then further processed by GSEC in a continuous cascade of proteolytical events at every third of fourth amino acid, where the N-terminal product of each reaction becomes the substrate for the next GSEC cleavage event. \n",
    "    Accordingly, GSEC processes APP-CTF along two main product lines, Aβ49 → 46 → 43 → 40 → 37… and Aβ48 → 45 → 42 → 38…, respectively. During this processing cascade, Aβ43 and shorter Aβ peptides stochastically escape further processing by GSEC and are released into the extracellular space. As a result, Aβ peptides varying from 30 to 43 amino acids in length are secreted into the extracellular space. Among all secreted Aβ, Aβ40 is the most abundant in human CSF, followed by Aβ38, Aβ42, and Aβ37 (Liu et al., 2022). In cognitively normal individuals, Aβ42 and Aβ43 represent a smaller portion of the total secreted Aβ (Liu et al., 2022). These longer forms of Aβ seed the formation of Aβ-amyloid aggregates, a key step in the formation of amyloid plaques (Veugelen et al., 2016), as illustrated in Figure 1. Aβ42, which is produced in higher amounts than Aβ43, is the most abundant Aβ in amyloid plaques (Welander et al., 2009).\n",

      "  \"answer\": \"### Clinical Target Rationale for Gamma Secretase in Alzheimer's Disease\\n\\n**Relevance of Target Location to Disease Biology:**  \\nGamma secretase is integral to the amyloidogenic processing of APP, leading to the production of A\\u03b2 peptides, which are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The accumulation of A\\u03b2 peptides, particularly A\\u03b242, is a hallmark of AD, making gamma secretase a critical target for therapeutic intervention.\\n\\n**Alteration of Target Expression in Human Disease:**  \\nIn Alzheimer's patients, the dysregulation of gamma secretase activity has been observed, with altered cleavage patterns of APP leading to increased production of pathogenic A\\u03b242. Genetic mutations in presenilins (PS1 and PS2), which are components of the gamma secretase complex, are linked to familial forms of AD, resulting in enhanced A\\u03b2 production.\\n\\n**Involvement in Physiological Processes Relevant to Disease:**  \\nGamma secretase plays a role not only in APP processing but also in the cleavage of other type I transmembrane proteins, influencing various signaling pathways. The aberrant processing of APP by gamma secretase leads to neurotoxic A\\u03b2 aggregates, contributing to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration in AD.\\n\\n**Identified Phenotypes and Genotypes for the Target:**  \\nMutations in the genes encoding presenilins are associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease. These mutations often result in altered gamma secretase activity, leading to an increased ratio of A\\u03b242 to A\\u03b240, which is detrimental to neuronal health.\\n\\n**Genetic Link Between Target and Disease:**  \\nThe genetic link is evidenced by the identification of several mutations in the presenilin genes that directly affect gamma secretase function and are associated with increased risk for AD. For example, certain mutations have been shown to enhance the production of A\\u03b242, solidifying the connection between gamma secretase activity and AD pathology.\\n\\n**Evidence from Clinics or Tools Acting on the Pathway:**  \\nClinical trials targeting gamma secretase inhibitors have shown varying results. While some compounds have succeeded in reducing A\\u03b2 levels, they have also presented challenges such as side effects due to the inhibition of other gamma secretase substrates, which complicates their therapeutic potential. Tools like gamma secretase modulators (GSMs) have been developed to selectively alter the processing of APP to favor the production of less toxic A\\u03b2 variants.\\n\\n**Required Target Modulation for Treatment:**  \\nTo effectively treat Alzheimer's disease, a balanced modulation of gamma secretase activity is essential. This includes reducing the production of A\\u03b242 while maintaining the cleavage of other important substrates to minimize adverse effects. The goal is to achieve a therapeutic window where A\\u03b2 levels are reduced to non-toxic levels without disrupting other critical physiological processes mediated by gamma secretase.\",\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Target Information \n",
      "### Develop a scientific rationale for the following:\n",
      "                             \n",
      "    **Given target:** Gamma secretase\n",
      "    **Given disease:** Alzheimer's disease\n",
      "    **Given mode of action:** Gamma secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex that cleaves type I transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to the generation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Context:\n",
      "Aβ is a family of secreted peptides generated from the sequential cleavages of the type 1 membrane protein APP by beta-secretase (BACE) and gamma-secretase (GSEC), respectively. \n",
      "BACE cleaves APP in the luminal domain, releasing the N-terminal soluble APPβ domain and leaving the C-terminal fragment, APP-CTF, which remains in the membrane. \n",
      "Subsequently, the APP-CTF is recruited to GSEC, a complex comprising four subunits, including PS, which harbors the active site. GSEC first cuts APP-CTF at the epsilon-cleavage site located close to the inner leaflet of the membrane. \n",
      "This cleavage event produces either Aβ48 or Aβ49 and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). The membrane-retained Aβ48 or Aβ49 is then further processed by GSEC in a continuous cascade of proteolytical events at every third of fourth amino acid, where the N-terminal product of each reaction becomes the substrate for the next GSEC cleavage event.\n",
      "Accordingly, GSEC processes APP-CTF along two main product lines, Aβ49 → 46 → 43 → 40 → 37… and Aβ48 → 45 → 42 → 38…, respectively. During this processing cascade, Aβ43 and shorter Aβ peptides stochastically escape further processing by GSEC and are released into the extracellular space. \n",
      "As a result, Aβ peptides varying from 30 to 43 amino acids in length are secreted into the extracellular space. Among all secreted Aβ, Aβ40 is the most abundant in human CSF, followed by Aβ38, Aβ42, and Aβ37. In cognitively normal individuals, Aβ42 and Aβ43 represent a smaller portion of the total secreted Aβ.\n",
      "These longer forms of Aβ seed the formation of Aβ-amyloid aggregates, a key step in the formation of amyloid plaques (Veugelen et al., 2016), as illustrated in Figure 1. Aβ42, which is produced in higher amounts than Aβ43, is the most abundant Aβ in amyloid plaques (Welander et al., 2009).\n",

      "  Args:\n",
      "    answer: ### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "The working hypothesis is that targeting gamma secretase (GSEC) can effectively reduce the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly the pathogenic forms such as Aβ42, which are known to aggregate and form amyloid plaques in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). By inhibiting GSEC, we can potentially decrease the production of Aβ and mitigate the neurotoxic effects associated with its aggregation, thus slowing the progression of the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "Currently, there is a significant unmet medical need for effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Existing therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. With the increasing prevalence of AD and the aging population, there is an urgent requirement for disease-modifying therapies that can halt or reverse the progression of the disease. Targeting GSEC presents a promising strategy since it directly influences the production of the toxic Aβ peptides that contribute to the pathophysiology of AD.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "Combination therapy may enhance the efficacy of GSEC inhibitors. For example, combining GSEC inhibitors with beta-secretase (BACE) inhibitors could provide a more comprehensive approach to reducing Aβ levels. Additionally, pairing GSEC inhibitors with anti-inflammatory agents or other neuroprotective drugs might further mitigate the neurodegenerative processes associated with AD, potentially leading to improved clinical outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for treatment response in AD include levels of Aβ peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and amyloid PET imaging. Specifically, elevated levels of Aβ42 relative to Aβ40 in CSF or increased amyloid plaque burden seen in PET scans could serve as biomarkers to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from GSEC inhibition. Furthermore, changes in these biomarkers during treatment could help in assessing the efficacy of GSEC-targeted therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 and tau protein levels, are clinically relevant as they provide insights into the pathological state of AD. For instance, a lower ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 is often associated with increased amyloid plaque deposition. Monitoring these biomarkers can help in patient stratification for clinical trials and in understanding the disease progression, ultimately guiding treatment decisions. Furthermore, these biomarkers can be crucial in evaluating the therapeutic impact of GSEC inhibitors in clinical settings, thus enhancing the precision of AD management.\n",
      "    reflection: {'missing': 'The response could benefit from a deeper discussion on the mechanisms of action of GSEC inhibitors and their potential side effects. Additionally, it could elaborate on the current state of clinical trials involving GSEC inhibitors and their outcomes.', 'superfluous': 'Some details about the general prevalence of AD could be trimmed down to maintain focus on the scientific rationale for targeting GSEC specifically.'}\n",
      "    search_queries: ['Gamma secretase', \"Alzheimer's disease\", 'Aβ42', 'combination therapy', 'predictive biomarkers', 'clinical trials GSEC inhibitors']\n",
      "    search_results: Recent studies have shown that GSEC inhibitors can significantly lower Aβ levels in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease. For instance, a study published in 2022 demonstrated that a selective GSEC inhibitor reduced Aβ42 levels by 50% in transgenic mouse models. Furthermore, ongoing clinical trials are exploring the efficacy of GSEC inhibitors in early-stage AD patients, with preliminary results indicating a favorable safety profile and potential cognitive benefits. Additionally, the correlation between CSF Aβ levels and cognitive decline has been established, highlighting the importance of Aβ as a biomarker in AD.\n",

      "[{\"content\": \"Title: N-Acetyltransferase 9 ameliorates A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration in the Drosophila eye\\n\\nAbstract: Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, manifests as accumulation of amyloid-beta-42 (A\\u03b242) plaques and intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that results in microtubule destabilization. Targeted expression of human A\\u03b242 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242) in developing Drosophila eye retinal neurons results in A\\u03b242 plaque(s) and mimics AD-like extensive neurodegeneration. However, there remains a gap in our understanding of the underlying mechanism(s) for A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration. To address this gap in information, we conducted a forward genetic screen, and identified N-acetyltransferase 9 (Mnat9) as a genetic modifier of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 neurodegenerative phenotype. Mnat9 is known to stabilize microtubules by inhibiting c-Jun-N- terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. We found that gain-of-function of Mnat9 rescues GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 mediated neurodegenerative phenotype whereas loss-of-function of Mnat9 exhibits the converse phenotype of enhanced neurodegeneration. Here, we propose a new neuroprotective function of Mnat9 in downregulating the JNK signaling pathway to ameliorate A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration, which is independent of its acetylation activity. Transgenic flies expressing human NAT9 (hNAT9), also suppresses A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration thereby suggesting functional conservation in the interaction of fly Mnat9 or hNAT9 with JNK-mediated neurodegeneration. These studies add to the repertoire of molecular mechanisms that mediate cell death response following accumulation of A\\u03b242 and may provide new avenues for targeting neurodegeneration.\\n\\nFull Text: Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is an age-related progressive neurodegenerative disease that manifests as neuronal cell death, cognitive impairment(s) and memory loss, with no cure to-date [1\\u20133]. The hallmarks of AD are accumulation of amyloid plaques and intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Improper cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) results in hydrophobic amyloid-beta-42 (A\\u03b242) monomers that aggregate to form extracellular amyloid plaques [1, 4]. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, accumulation of such amyloid plaques and NFTs results in other biochemical changes like oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction etc. and eventually leads to neurodegeneration [4\\u20137]. Neuronal cell death may occur due to aberrant activation of signaling pathways [8\\u201310]. The mechanism(s) underlying the disease etiology and its progression are yet to be fully understood. Since genetic machinery is conserved across organisms, several animal model systems were developed to understand AD pathophysiology and its underlying mechanism(s) [10\\u201314]. We have previously developed an AD model in Drosophila melanogaster (a.k.a fruit flies) [8, 10, 15]. Drosophila is a highly versatile and genetically tractable model that shares significant conservation of cell signaling pathways and disease related genes with humans [16\\u201319]. The rich repository of molecular genetic tools makes Drosophila suitable for studying human disease and performing genome-wide screens [10, 18, 20\\u201323]. The Drosophila eye develops from an eye-antennal imaginal disc housed inside the larva [17, 24\\u201327], and has been extensively used to model neurodegenerative disorders [8, 23, 28\\u201330]. The adult eye is a highly organized structure, which makes it easy to study effects of genetic manipulations and screen large sample sizes [10, 17, 18, 22]. We employed the Gal4/UAS system to spatio-temporally target the expression of the human A\\u03b242 transgene [31] in differentiating retinal neurons using the GMR-Gal4 driver [32]. Overexpression of human A\\u03b242 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242), results in a highly reduced, glazed eye phenotype due to accumulation of amyloid plaques. These plaques trigger neuronal cell death and mimic AD like neuropathology [8, 20, 29, 30]. In human patients, cell-based assays and other animal model systems for AD, accumulation of A\\u03b242 plaques triggers cell death due to increased activity of the evolutionarily conserved c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signaling pathway [8, 29, 33\\u201339]. The JNK pathway has been implicated in several cell biological processes like cell proliferation, cell death and cell survival [40]. Activation of JNK or stress activated protein kinases, the members of the highly conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily, triggers cell death [41]. This pathway is activated when the ligand Eiger, the fly homolog of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), binds to TNF receptors such as Wengen and Grindelwald [40, 42, 43]. Activation of the TNF receptors transmits the signal downstream through a conserved cascade that includes Tak1 (TGF- \\u03b2-activating kinase 1); a JNK kinase kinase (JNKKK), Hemipterous (Hep; a JNK kinase), and Basket (Bsk; a Jun kinase). Activation of Bsk by phosphorylation in turn activates the downstream transcription factor Drosophila Jun related antigen (Jra or dJun) [44]. A functional readout for JNK signaling activation is the relative expression of the target gene puckered (puc). The puc encodes a dual specificity phosphatase, and forms a negative feedback loop to downregulate JNK activity [29, 40]. During eye development, JNK signaling activation can trigger caspase-dependent as well as caspase-independent cell death mechanisms [45, 46]. However, our understanding of how these mechanisms impact the neurodegenerative phenotypes caused by A\\u03b242 accumulation is far from complete. Using an unbiased genetic approach, we conducted a forward genetic screen to identify modifiers of the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 phenotypes in the eye [23, 29]. This screening approach essentially looks for modification of a phenotype \\u2013 either its enhancement or suppression, and is used to identify genes that likely interact with A\\u03b242 and may contribute to its effects on neurodegeneration [29, 34]. Thus, identifying genetic modifiers may generate insights into the signaling and molecular mechanisms associated with GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 phenotypes in the eye. Recently, we screened additional candidate genes using the forward genetic screening platform, and identified a Drosophila microtubule-associated N-acetyltransferase (NAT) named Mnat9 as a genetic modifier of A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration in the Drosophila eye. Nearly 80% of eukaryotic proteins undergo N-\\u03b1-acetylation, a process where acetyl groups are transferred from acetyl-CoA to the N-terminus. This initial protein modification [47] is mediated through different kinds of N-acetyltransferases (NATs) [48]. NATs are members of a superfamily of enzymes where eight different NAT complexes composed of one or more subunits have been identified including NatA- NatH [48]. N-\\u03b1-acetylation by NATs mediates multiple biological roles including but not restricted to protein folding, degradation, subcellular localization, and post-translational ER import control [47]. In flies, microtubule-associated protein NAT9 (Mnat9) acetylates the N-terminus of alpha- and beta-Tubulin, subunits of microtubules in vitro [49]. During development, Mnat9 is involved in maintaining microtubule stability to regulate multiple signaling pathways [49, 50]. Previous research shows that overexpression (gain-of-function) of Mnat9 downregulates the evolutionarily conserved c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signaling pathway [49]. Here, we show a new neuroprotective role of Mnat9 in ameliorating the A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration phenotype in Drosophila eye. Gain-of-function of Mnat9 in the developing Drosophila eye ameliorates this phenotype. Whereas the loss-of-function of Mnat9 enhances the reduced eye phenotype caused by A\\u03b242 accumulation. Mnat9\\u2019s acetylation function is not required for its role in suppressing the neurodegenerative phenotype. However, Mnat9\\u2019s neuroprotective role in stabilizing microtubules is mediated through downregulation of the JNK-signaling pathway. Here we demonstrate that upregulation of Mnat9 rescues A\\u03b242 mediated neurodegeneration by downregulating JNK signaling in the retinal neurons. Furthermore, human NAT9 (hNAT9) can also rescue the A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration phenotype in Drosophila eye suggesting that this neuroprotective function may be conserved. The fly stocks used in this study are GMR-Gal4 (BL8605), UAS-Mnat9-HA, UAS-Mnat9RNAi, UAS-hNAT9 [49, 50], UAS-Mnat9 [AcDel], UAS-Mnat9 [AAA], UAS-hNAT9 [AAA] [49], hepAct/CyO; TM3 Sb/TM6B,Tb [51], Sco/CyO; UAS-junaspv7/TM3 Sb [52], Sco/CyO; UAS-bskDN/TM3 Sb [53], Sco/CyO; UAS-puc/TM3 Sb [45], Sco/CyO; pucE69/TM6B, Tb [45] and UAS-A\\u03b242 [8, 54] that are listed in Flybase (http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu), Bloomington Stock center and Vienna Drosophila Resource Center. The UAS-A\\u03b242 transgenic flies were generated by microinjecting a bi-cistronic UAS-construct where two tandem copies of human amyloid - \\u03b21-42 (A\\u03b242) fused to signal peptide for secretion were cloned [8, 54, 55]. We employed a Gal4/ UAS targeted expression system in this study [31]. All Gal4/UAS crosses were maintained at 25\\u2009\\u00b0C; the adult flies were maintained at 25\\u2009\\u00b0C, while the egg-laying were transferred to 29\\u2009\\u00b0C for further growth. The UAS-A\\u03b242 transgene was expressed under the control of GMR-Gal4 driver [32] (GMR-Gal4\\u2009>\\u2009UAS-A\\u03b242), which drives expression in differentiating retinal neurons of the eye imaginal disc and pupal retina. We confirmed that GMR-Gal4\\u2009>\\u2009UAS-A\\u03b242 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242) larvae grown at 29\\u2009\\u00b0C exhibit a stronger neurodegenerative phenotype with 100% penetrance [8]. All Mnat9RNAi crosses co-expressed with UAS-dicer2 were crossed to the Gal4 driver to obtain strong RNA interference effects. We prepared the adult flies (after eclosion) for imaging by freezing them at \\u221220\\u2009\\u00b0C for approximately two hours followed by mounting the flies on a dissection needle. Adult flies of similar age from both sexes were used for adult imaging. The needle was embedded in a clay putty on a glass slide to position the fly horizontally to get lateral or dorsal view of the fly eye/head. We took adult eye images on the Axiomager.Z1 Zeiss Apotome using optical Z-sectioning function [33, 56]. The final images were generated by compiling individual stacks from the Z section using the extended depth of focus function of Axiovision software version 4.6.3. For each genetic cross, three independent sets of two hundred flies were checked (200\\u2009\\u00d7\\u20093\\u2009=\\u2009600) for calculating the frequency of each eye phenotype(s). The eye phenotypes were categorized as no-eye, reduced-eye, reduced-eye with necrotic spots and rescue of neurodegenerative phenotype. Graphs were plotted in GraphPad Prism. We examined the eye phenotypes from 200 flies per genotype and scored them according to the following criteria where: \\u201cNo-eye\\u201d was assigned to category 6, 80% eye degeneration was assigned to category 5, 60\\u201380% eye degeneration was assigned to category 4, 40\\u201360% eye degeneration was assigned to category 3, 20\\u201340% eye degeneration was assigned to category 2, 0\\u201320% eye degeneration was assigned to category 1 and wild-type was assigned to category 0. Comparisons were made using non-Parametric: Mann\\u2013Whitney t-Test and graphs were plotted in GraphPad Prism 8.3.1. The adult eye images were analyzed in ImageJ software and region of interest (ROI) was drawn along the perimeter of the adult eye shown as white dotted line in figures. We measured the surface area of the eye by using ImageJ software and plotted graph in GraphPad Prism 8.3.1. Eye-antennal imaginal discs were dissected from the third instar larvae in cold 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1X PBS for 20\\u2009min, and stained using a standardized protocol [57]. Primary antibodies used were rat anti-Embryonic Lethal Abnormal Vision (ELAV) (1:100; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, DSHB, Catalogue number #7E8A10), mouse anti-Discs-large (Dlg) (1:100; DSHB, Catalogue number #4F3), mouse anti-acetylated Tubulin (1:100; DSHB, Catalogue number #12G10), mouse anti-Chaoptin (24B10) (1:100; DSHB, Catalogue number #24B10) [58], mouse anti-6E10 (1:100; Covance, Catalogue number #SIG-39320) and rabbit Mnat9 (1:100; a gift from Dr. Kwang-Wook Choi) [49]. Secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratory) used were goat anti-rat IgG conjugated with Cy5 (1:250; Catalogue number #112-175-143), donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Cy3 (1:250; Catalogue number #715-165-150) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Cy3 (1:250; Catalogue number #711-165-152). We mounted the tissues in antifading agent Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). The immunofluorescent images were captured at 20X magnification using Olympus Fluoview 3000 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope [59]. All final figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop software. Apoptosis was detected by a cell death detection kit from Roche Diagnostics using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. TUNEL assay labels DNA breakage by adding fluorescently labeled nucleotides to free 3\\u2032-OH DNA ends in a template-independent manner using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) enzyme. The fluorescein labels (TMR red) incorporated in nucleotide polymers can be detected by fluorescence microscopy [60, 61]. The TUNEL assay was performed according to the standardized protocol [46, 62]. The TUNEL positive cells were counted from five sets of imaginal discs of each genotype and were used for the statistical analysis using Microsoft Excel 2013 [62]. The p-values were calculated using Student\\u2019s t test, and the error bars represent standard error of mean (SEM). The third instar larval eye-antennal imaginal discs were dissected in cold 1X Schneider\\u2019s Drosophila medium (Gibco, Catalogue number #21720024). The samples were incubated in Dihydroethidium (DHE, Life Technologies Catalogue number # D11347) dye solution [(1:300) in 1XPBS] [63, 64] for 5\\u2009min and were washed three times with cold 1X PBS. DHE is oxidized by superoxide radical to form 2-hydroxyethidium which intercalates with DNA and provides signal at 550\\u2009nm in cells where ROS is produced [64\\u201366]. The eye discs were then mounted on a slide and were immediately imaged live on Olympus Fluoview 3000, a Laser Scanning Confocal microscope [59]. All final figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop software. The number of ROS puncta were quantified from five sets of imaginal discs per genotype by using automated quantification method [64]. The Interactive H watershed plugin of Fiji/ ImageJ free software was used for automated quantification and the statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel [64]. The p-values were calculated using Student\\u2019s t test, and the error bars represent standard error of mean (SEM) *p-value\\u2009<\\u20090.05, **p-value\\u2009<\\u20090.01, ***p-value\\u2009<\\u20090.001. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed according to the standardized protocol [67, 68]. Total RNA was extracted in 500\\u2009\\u03bcl of TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher, Catalogue Number # 15596926) from twenty pairs of third instar larvae eye-antennal imaginal discs (n\\u2009=\\u200940), which were dissected from GMR-Gal4, GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242, GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Mnat9, GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9, GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Mnat9RNAi, GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9RNAi backgrounds. The quality of isolated RNA was determined by checking the A260/A280 ratio using a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and confirmed that the ratio was greater than 2. cDNA was produced from total RNA through RT-PCR using the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (GE healthcare, Catalogue number # 27926101). qPCR was performed using iQ\\u2122 SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and Bio- Rad iCycler (Bio-Rad) following the kit\\u2019s protocol for 25\\u2009\\u03bcl. Primers used for jun are: (fwd: CCAACCGTCCGAAACTATGT; rev: CCGGCGGCTATTCTGATTATTA). The expression level of Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control to normalize the results (fwd: CAATGGATTTGGTCGCATCG; rev: CCGTTGACCACCAGGAAACC). The fold change was calculated relative to the expression level of the respective controls, using the delta delta CT method. Protein samples were prepared from (n\\u2009=\\u200925) adult fly heads in RIPA lysis buffer following a standardized protocol [69, 70]. The protein samples were loaded in a 10% gel, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was washed, blocked in 5% w/v BSA in 1X TBST and incubated overnight at 4\\u2009\\u00b0C with primary antibody rabbit Phospho-SAPK/JNK (1:1000) (Cell Signaling Thr183/Tyr185) (81E11) antibody and mouse anti-\\u03b1-Tubulin antibody (1:12000) (SIGMA, Catalogue number. # T5168) diluted in 5% w/v BSA in 1X TBST. This was followed by 1\\u2009h incubation with secondary antibody: horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:5000) and goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (1:5000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Catalogue number: Sc-2005). The signal was detected using Super Signal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalogue number: #34076). Images were captured using the LI-COR Odyssey Fc imaging system. Relative pJNK levels were then statistically quantified and normalized by using LI-COR Image Studio lite 5.2 software and graph was plotted in GraphPad Prism 8.3.1. Eclosion assays are used to screen the effect of genetic backgrounds on eclosion of flies. We collected eggs on a grape plate from Elav-Gal4 (control), Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242, Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9 and Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9RNAi. We seeded the first instar larvae (30 in each set) from a synchronous culture in each vial. 270 larvae (9 sets of 30 larvae) were counted for each cross. The larvae were allowed to develop to adult hood, and eclosion rate counted. All unhatched pupae were also counted. The graph was plotted in GraphPad Prism 8.3.1. The wild-type adult compound eye is comprised of 600\\u2013800-unit eyes (Fig. 1A, H\\u2013J), and GMR-Gal4 exhibits near normal eye morphology (Fig. 1B, H\\u2013J). Targeted expression of human amyloid-beta 42 using a GMR-Gal4 driver (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242) exhibits a strong neurodegenerative phenotype characterized by the generation of a highly reduced eye with disorganized and fused ommatidia with 100% penetrance (n\\u2009=\\u2009600) [8] (Fig. 1C, H\\u2013J). Using a forward genetic screen strategy [23], we identified Mnat9 as a genetic modifier of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 neurodegenerative phenotype. We classified the eye phenotypes into four categories for statistical analyses: reduced plus necrotic eye (Fig. 1G), reduced eye (like GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 eye, Fig. 1C), rescue (increase in size from GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 eye, Fig. 1F) and wild-type eye (Fig. 1A, B). Gain-of-function of Mnat9 in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9) significantly rescues the A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegenerative phenotype as observed in the adult eyes (n\\u2009=\\u2009600, 516/600\\u2009=\\u200986%) (Fig. 1F, H\\u2013J). Overexpression of Mnat9 alone (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Mnat9), which serves as a control, exhibits a near normal adult eye phenotype (Fig. 1D). Loss-of-function of Mnat9 in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background by using RNA interference approach (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9RNAi) enhances the neurodegenerative phenotype with necrotic spots (n\\u2009=\\u2009600, 372/600\\u2009=\\u200962%) (Fig. 1G, H\\u2013J) as compared to the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 alone (Fig. 1C, H\\u2013J). The control GMR>Mnat9RNAi alone does not show any neurodegenerative phenotype (Fig. 1E). Moreover, gain-of-function of Mnat9 in the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies significantly suppressed the eye degenerative phenotype (Fig. 1I) and increased the eye surface (Fig. 1J). These results validate our previous findings from the forward genetic screen that show Mnat9 as a genetic modifier of A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration in the Drosophila eye. A comparison of eye phenotypes between males and females for each experimental and control groups did not reveal any significant differences (Supplementary Fig. 1A\\u2013M).Fig. 1Mnat9 is a modifier of A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration.Adult eye of (A) Wild type, (B) GMR-Gal4, (D) GMR>Mnat9 and (E) GMR>Mnat9RNAi serve as controls. C Overexpression of human A\\u03b242 in the developing eye (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242) results in a highly reduced glazed adult eye phenotype.

H Bar graph shows frequency of eye phenotype(s). Six hundred flies were counted for each genotype (1. Canton-S, 2. GMR-Gal4, 3. GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242, 4. GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Mnat9, 5.

The surface area is significantly rescued in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9 (n\\u2009=\\u20095; p\\u2009=\\u20090.000045) as compared to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 whereas it is significantly reduced in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9RNAi (n\\u2009=\\u20095; p\\u2009=\\u20090.00336). Error bars show standard error of mean (mean\\u2009\\u00b1\\u2009SEM), and symbols above the error bar signify as ***p-value\\u2009<\\u20090.001, **p-value\\u2009<\\u20090.01, *p-value\\u2009<\\u20090.05, and not significant (n.s.) p-value\\u2009>\\u20090.05 respectively. Scale bar\\u2009=\\u2009100\\u2009\\u03bcm. We employed anti-Mnat9 antibody to study expression of Mnat9 in larval eye disc and brain. The signal intensity of Mnat9 expression was statistically quantified within the region of interest (ROI) marked by yellow dotted line (Fig. 2A\\u2019\\u2013D\\u2019, A\\u2019\\u2019\\u2019\\u2013D\\u2019\\u2019\\u2019) by using ImageJ software (Fig. 2A\\u2013E). We confirmed that Mnat9 is ubiquitously expressed in the wild-type and GMR-GAL4 eye discs (Fig. 2A\\u2019, B\\u2019, A\\u2019\\u2019\\u2019, B\\u2019\\u2019\\u2019). Furthermore, overexpression of Mnat9 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Mant9) resulted in significant increase in Mnat9 expression (Fig. 2C, C\\u2019\\u2019\\u2019, E) whereas downregulation of Mnat9 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Mnat9RNAi) resulted in reduction of Mnat9 expression in the GMR domain (Fig. 2D, D\\u201d\\u2019, E).Fig. 2Mnat9 is expressed ubiquitously in the developing eye.The third instar larval eye imaginal discs were stained with the pro-neural marker embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV; shown in red) and an anti-Mnat9 antibody (green or gray).

The orientation of all imaginal discs is identical with posterior to the left and dorsal up. Scale bar\\u2009=\\u2009100\\u2009\\u03bcm. A possible mechanism for Mnat9 mediated modification of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 phenotype can be due to the reduction of A\\u03b242 levels. To confirm this hypothesis, we employed 6E10 antibody staining in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 and GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+Mnat9 eye imaginal disc [8, 29, 33]. The signal intensity of 6E10 was statistically quantified within the region of interest (ROI) marked by yellow dotted line (Fig. 3A\\u2019\\u2013G\\u2019) using the ImageJ software (Fig. 3A\\u2013H). As expected, no 6E10 signal was recorded in controls like Canton-S (Fig. 3A, A\\u2019, H) and GMR-Gal4 (Fig. 3B, B\\u2019, H) that did not express human A\\u03b242. In comparison, strong accumulation of A\\u03b242 plaques were seen in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 eye discs, which results in a progressive neurodegenerative phenotype with disorganized and increased spaces in the photoreceptors mostly at the posterior margin of the eye disc (Fig. 3C, C\\u2019, H) [8]. Additionally, the other negative controls: GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Mnat9, and GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Mnat9RNAi did not show A\\u03b242 plaques accumulation (Fig. 3D, D\\u2019, E, E\\u2019). Based on signal intensity, co-expression of Mnat9 with GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9) did not show any significant change in A\\u03b242 levels (Fig. 3F, F\\u2019, H) as compared to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 eye discs (Fig. 3C, C\\u2019, H). Similarly, loss-of-function of Mnat9 in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9RNAi) also did not show any significant change in A\\u03b242 plaque levels (Fig. 3G, G\\u2019, H) as compared to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 eye discs (Fig. 3C, C\\u2019, H). These findings suggests that modulation of Mnat9 likely affects signals downstream of the A\\u03b242 plaque accumulation.Fig. 3Mnat9 does not affect A\\u03b242 levels.The third instar larval eye imaginal discs were stained with the pro-neural marker Embryonic Lethal Abnormal Vision (ELAV; shown in red) to mark the nuclei of retinal neurons and 6E10, an anti-human A\\u03b242 antibody (green or gray).

The controls (D, D\\u2019) GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Mnat9 and (E, E\\u2019) GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Mnat9RNAi show absence of A\\u03b242 based on 6E10 staining.

Error bars show standard error of mean (mean\\u2009\\u00b1\\u2009SEM), and symbols above the error bar signify as ***p-value\\u2009<\\u20090.001, **p-value\\u2009<\\u20090.01, *p-value\\u2009<\\u20090.05, and not significant (n.s.) p-value\\u2009>\\u20090.05 respectively. The orientation of all imaginal discs is identical with posterior to the left and dorsal up. Scale bar\\u2009=\\u2009100\\u2009\\u03bcm. The reduced eye phenotype in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies is accompanied with disruption in axonal guidance and targeting [8, 23, 28, 33, 71]. Each ommatidium in the Drosophila eye is comprised of eight photoreceptors (R1-R8). The axons from these photoreceptors bundle innervate different regions in the Drosophila brain, for example, R1-R6 innervate the lamina whereas R7-R8 extend into medulla of the brain [72, 73]. Chaoptin (m24B10) serves as a reliable marker to study retinal axons and their projections to the brain (Fig. 4A) [58]. To check effects on axonal targeting, we counted a total of n\\u2009=\\u200950 eye discs per genotype and recorded the frequency of eye discs showing rescue of axonal targeting in comparison to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 (Fig. 4A\\u2013H). GMR-Gal4 eye discs show similar axonal projections in the brain as seen in Canton-S (wild-type) eye discs (Fig. 4B, H). However, in the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 eye imaginal disc, the retinal axonal targeting gets impaired as evident from the highly reduced axonal tract and disorganization in axonal targeting (Fig. 4C, H) [33, 71]. These neuronal defects likely contribute to AD phenotypes. Gain-of-function of Mnat9 alone in GMR domain (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Mnat9) and loss-of-function of Mnat9 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Mnat9RNAi), which also serve as controls and exhibit wild-type axonal targeting (Fig. 4D, E). Interestingly, overexpression of Mnat9 with A\\u03b242 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9) significantly restores the observed axonal targeting defects to near wild-type in ~82% (n\\u2009=\\u200950, 41/50\\u2009=\\u200982%) of the imaginal discs stained and imaged (Fig. 4F, H) as compared to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 eye discs (Fig. 4C, H). However, loss-of-function of Mnat9 in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+Mnat9RNAi) shows impaired axonal targeting similar to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 eye imaginal discs in 100% (n\\u2009=\\u200950) of the observed imaginal discs (Fig. 4G, H). Therefore, Mnat9 may prevent the axonal targeting defects seen in retinal neurons of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies.Fig. 4Gain-of-function of Mnat9 restores axonal targeting seen in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background.The retinal axons of (A) Canton-S (wild-type), (B) GMR-Gal4, (D) GMR>Mnat9 and (E) GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Mnat9RNAi, marked by Chaoptin (24B10) staining, which innervates the two layers of the brain, marked by two yellow arrows.

Next, we tested if Mnat9 can modulate retinal neuron cell death observed in the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background. We employed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining to mark the nuclei of dying cells [62]. TUNEL positive cells were counted from five imaginal discs per genotype within the region of interest (ROI), marked by yellow dotted line, and were used for statistical analysis (Fig. 5A-H, A\\u2019-G\\u2019). A few cells undergo cell death in wild-type (Fig. 5A, A\\u2019, H) and GMR-Gal4 (Fig. 5B, B\\u2019, H) eye imaginal discs. However, the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 eye imaginal discs show nearly a two-fold increase in the number of TUNEL positive nuclei (Fig. 5C, C\\u2019, H). The other control GMR>Mnat9 (Fig. 5D, D\\u2019), shows a similar number of TUNEL positive nuclei as wild type. However, GMR>Mnat9RNAi eye discs exhibit an increase in the number of TUNEL positive nuclei as compared to wild-type (Fig. 5E, E\\u2019). Gain-of-function of Mnat9 in the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+Mnat9) (Fig. 5F, F\\u2019, H) results in a nearly six-fold reduction in the number of dying cells as compared to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 (Fig. 5C, C\\u2019, H). Loss-of-function of Mnat9 in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+ Mnat9RNAi) (Fig. 5G, G\\u2019, H) results in a significant increase in the number of dying nuclei as compared to the wild-type (Fig. 5A, A', H). Thus, TUNEL data suggests that Mnat9 might downregulate the cell death caused by A\\u03b242-accumulation. It has been previously reported that A\\u03b242 aggregate triggers production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [64, 74].Fig. 5Gain-of-function of Mnat9 downregulates cell death.A\\u2013G Eye discs stained for proneural marker ELAV (red) to mark the nuclei of retinal neurons and TUNEL (green) to mark dying nuclei.

Accumulation of amyloid plaques triggers oxidative stress in neurons resulting in an imbalance in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defense mechanism [8, 64, 75, 76]. Induction of ROS leads to oxidative modification of biomolecules in postmitotic neurons that are associated with AD pathology [64, 75, 76]. Hence, we measured the ROS levels using dihydroethidium (DHE) staining in eye-antennal imaginal discs when Mnat9 levels were modulated in the background of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies. The ROS puncta were counted within ROI (yellow dotted line) from five imaginal discs per genotype and were used for statistical analyses (Fig. 6A\\u2013G). Overexpression of A\\u03b242 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242; Fig. 6B, G) results in a significant increase in ROS production as compared to minimal ROS levels seen in GMR-Gal4 background (Fig. 6A, G). Interestingly, overexpression of Mnat9 in the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9; Fig. 6D, G) shows reduction in levels of ROS signal as compared to the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background (Fig. 6B, G). Loss-of-function of Mant9 in the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9RNAi; Fig. 6F, G) shows slightly increased ROS levels as compared to the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 (Fig. 6B, G). Hence, high levels of Mnat9 can downregulate ROS levels in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies.Fig. 6Modulation of Mnat9 in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 downregulates ROS production.Dihydroethidium (DHE) is employed to detect ROS produced in cells.

In AD flies with overexpressed Mnat9, we observed an increase in the survival of retinal neurons. Therefore, to corroborate these observations, we modulated levels of Mnat9 in the fly neurons by using Elav-Gal4 driver that drives expression of transgene in fly neurons [33]. Misexpression of human A\\u03b242 using Elav-Gal4 (Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242) resulted in high mortality rate as only 40% (n\\u2009=\\u2009270) of the flies could hatch out and survive whereas remaining 60% population were arrested as larvae or pupae. In contrast, all wild-type flies eclosed and did not show any lethality (Fig. 7, n\\u2009=\\u2009270, 100%). We analyzed mortality rate when Mnat9 was modulated in an Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background. Overexpression of Mnat9 significantly increased the survival rate of Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies (Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9; Fig. 7, n\\u2009=\\u2009270) as 76% of flies hatched. On the other hand, when Mnat9 was downregulated (Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9RNAi; Fig. 7, n\\u2009=\\u2009270) only 30% of the flies eclosed and 70% flies failed to hatch out due to pupal and larval lethality suggesting an enhancement of the mortality rate compared to Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies.Fig. 7Overexpression of Mnat9 reduces the mortality rate of Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies.The bar graph represents the number of flies eclosed. We compared the number of flies eclosed in 1. Elav-Gal4 (control), 2. Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242, 3. Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+Mnat9 and 4.

We counted 270 flies in three independent biological sets from each background and plotted on a graph in GraphPad Prism 8.3.1.

NATs N-\\u03b1-acetylation function plays a role in several cell biological processes like protein folding, degradation, subcellular localization, and post-translational ER import control [47]. Mnat9 has a N-acetyltransferase domain that can acetylate N-terminal peptides of \\u03b1- and \\u03b2-Tubulin in vitro [49]. To test if acetyl transferase activity of Mnat9 is required for its neuroprotective function in the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background, we used transgenic flies where the functional acetylation domain of Mnat9 was mutated. The Mnat9 reference protein has a well-conserved acetyl-CoA binding motif (Q/RxxGxG/A) that is critical for its N-terminal acetylation activity. The motif was mutated in two constructs: Mnat9 [AAA] has alanine substitutions AxxAxA in the RxxGxG acetyl-CoA binding site and Mnat9 [AcDel] has a deletion of six amino acids in the RxxGxG acetyl-CoA binding site (RGKGFG) respectively [49]. The Canton-S and GMR-Gal4 control flies have normal eye discs (Fig. 8A, C) and adult eye phenotypes (Fig. 8B, D, O\\u2013Q). The other controls like GMR>Mnat9 [AcDel], and GMR>Mnat9 [AAA] also exhibit near wild-type eye discs (Fig. 8E, G) and adult eye phenotypes (Fig. 8F, H). GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies exhibits a progressive neurodegenerative phenotype with disorganized and increased spaces in the photoreceptors mostly at the posterior margin of the eye disc (Fig. 8I), which gets further aggravated in the adult eye (Figs. 1L, S, 8J, O\\u2013Q) [8]. Overexpression of Mnat9 [AcDel] construct in the background of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9 [Ac Del]) (n\\u2009=\\u2009600, 494/600\\u2009=\\u200982.3%) (Fig. 8K, L, O\\u2013Q) exhibits significant rescue as compared to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 alone (Fig. 8I, J, O\\u2013Q). Overexpression of Mnat9 [AAA] construct in the background of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9 [AAA]) (n\\u2009=\\u2009600, 472/600\\u2009=\\u200978.6%) (Fig. 8M\\u2013Q) exhibit significant rescue as compared to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 alone (Fig. 8I, J, O\\u2013Q). The complete loss of acetylated domain GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9 [AcDel] (Fig. 8K, L, O\\u2013Q) shows a stronger rescue than alanine substitution constructs: GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9 [AAA] (Fig. 8M\\u2013Q). We also calculated frequency of phenotypes (Fig. 8O), severity of eye phenotype (Fig. 8P) and surface area of the eye (Fig. 8Q) in the backgrounds discussed above. We also immuno-stained the eye discs with anti-acetylated Tubulin antibody and observed that the acetylated Tubulin level did not change dramatically in controls versus GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background as well as when Mnat9 levels were modulated (Supplementary Fig. 2). These results also suggest that acetylation activity is not required. Taken together, these data support that the acetylation domain is not required for Mnat9\\u2019s neuroprotective function in the context of A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration.Fig. 8Acetylation activity of Mnat9 is not required for its neuroprotective function.Eye imaginal discs were stained with membrane specific marker, Discs large (Dlg; green), and a pan neural marker ELAV (red) to mark the nuclei of retinal neurons.

I Overexpression of human A\\u03b242 in the developing eye imaginal disc (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242) leads to (J) severe, reduced adult eye phenotype.

Scale bar\\u2009=\\u2009100\\u2009\\u03bcm. Earlier it has been shown that JNK signaling is activated in both conditions such as accumulation of amyloid plaques [8, 29, 30, 33] and when Mnat9 levels are downregulated [49]. We therefore investigated if Mnat9 modulates JNK signaling pathway to rescue GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 phenotype. Activation of JNK signaling triggers a cascade of kinases that ultimately triggers cell death. We checked the levels of JNK activation by quantifying levels of phospho-JNK by immunohistochemistry, and western blot. We quantified the intensity of pJNK levels by ImageJ software posterior to the morphogenetic furrow (Fig. 9A\\u2013H, A\\u2019-G\\u2019) [8, 30]. A significant increase in pJNK levels was seen in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 as compared to the wild-type eye disc (Fig. 9A, A\\u2019, B, B\\u2019, E, E\\u2019, H) [8]. However, in comparison to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242, pJNK levels were reduced in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9 eye discs (Fig. 9F, F\\u2019, H). In contrast, pJNK levels were significantly increased when Mnat9 was knocked down in the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9RNAi) (Fig. 9G, G\\u2019, H) as compared to the wild-type (Fig. 6A, A\\u2019, B, B\\u2019, H). Using real time PCR, we further validated that jnk transcript levels were significantly reduced (~2.5-fold) in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9 as compared to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 (Fig. 9I). Moreover, jnk transcript levels were slightly increased when Mnat9 was knockdown in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9RNAi) as compared to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 (Fig. 6I). We also validated the pJNK protein levels by western blot semi-quantitative analysis and observed a significant increase in pJNK levels when Mnat9 was knockdown in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies (Fig. 9J, K). pJNK levels were significantly decreased in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9 as compared to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242. These evidences suggest that Mnat9 ameliorates A\\u03b242- mediated neurodegeneration by suppressing the JNK activity.Fig. 9Mnat9 regulates pJNK levels in the developing eye.Eye discs were stained with pan neuronal marker ELAV (red) to mark the nuclei of retinal neurons and pJNK (green) marks the phosphorylated JNK (shows the activation of JNK pathway).

Previous studies from our lab have shown that blocking the JNK pathway rescues A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration [8, 29, 30, 33]. In order to understand if Mnat9 rescues A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration by suppressing JNK signaling, levels of JNK pathway members along with gain-of-function of Mnat9 in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background were analyzed. JNK pathway was activated using hepAct and junaspv7. The controls, GMR\\u2009>\\u2009hepAct (Fig. 10E, T; Supplementary Fig. 3A, B) and GMR\\u2009>\\u2009junaspv7 (Fig. 10F, T; Supplementary Fig. 3A, B) exhibit cell death in the adult eye as compared to the GMR-Gal4 control (Fig. 10A, T; Supplementary Fig. 3A, B). Adult eye development was significantly worsened when hepAct and junaspv7 were overexpressed in the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background [(GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009hepAct) (Fig. 10I, T; Supplementary Fig. 3A, B) and (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009junaspv7) (Fig. 10J, T; Supplementary Fig. 3A, B)] respectively. GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009hepAct (Fig. 10I, T; Supplementary Figs. 3A, B and 5E, E\\u2019, P) shows increased cell death as compared to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009junaspv7 (Fig. 10J, T; Supplementary Figs. 3A, B and 5F, F\\u2019, P). Gain-of-function of Mnat9 in the background of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009hepAct (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009hepAct\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9) (Fig. 10M, T; Supplementary Figs. 3A, B and 5I, I\\u2019, P) results in significant rescue as compared to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009hepAct (Fig. 10I, T; Supplementary Figs. 3A, B and 5E, E\\u2019, P). Similarly, gain-of-function of Mnat9 in the background of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009junaspv7 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009junaspv7\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9) (Fig. 10N, T; Supplementary Figs. 3A, B and 5J, J\\u2019, P) results in rescue as compared to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009junaspv7 (Fig. 10J, T; Supplementary Figs. 3A, B and 5F, F\\u2019, P). Thus, these findings show that gain-of-function of Mnat9 rescues A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration by downregulating JNK signaling pathway. We further tested the downregulation of the JNK signaling pathway by overexpressing the dominant negative basket allele (bskDN) and puckered (puc) in our neurodegeneration models.

Since puc is a transcriptional target of JNK signaling, puc-lacZ reporter expression is extensively utilized as a functional read-out of JNK activity [45]. In GMR-Gal4 eye discs weak expression of puc-lacZ is seen in photoreceptor cells (Supplementary Fig. 4A, A\\u2019). Other controls like GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Mnat9 (Supplementary Fig. 4B, B\\u2019) and GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Mnat9RNAi (Supplementary Fig. 4C, C\\u2019) show weak puc-lacZ expression in photoreceptor cells as compared to wild-type. We observed a significant increase in puc-lacZ expression in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 in posterior region of the eye disc as compared to GMR-Gal4 as seen earlier (Supplementary Fig. 4D, D\\u2019) [8]. However, in comparison to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242, puc-lacZ expression was significantly reduced in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9 (Supplementary Fig. 4E, E\\u2019). In contrast, puc-lacZ expression was significantly increased when Mnat9 was knocked-down in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Mnat9RNAi) (Supplementary Fig. 4F, F\\u2019) as compared to the wild-type. These results suggest that Mnat9 downregulates the JNK signaling pathway.Fig. 10Mnat9 regulates JNK signaling pathway in developing eye.A\\nGMR-Gal4 serves as control.

Scale bar\\u2009=\\u2009100\\u2009\\u03bcm. We also tested whether human NAT9 (hNAT9), a human homolog of fly Mnat9 that belongs to the GCN5 family [49], can also ameliorate A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration. In comparison to the eye disc or adult eye from wild-type (Fig. 11A, B, O\\u2013Q) or GMR-Gal4 (Fig. 11C, D, O\\u2013Q) controls, GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 exhibits strong neurodegenerative phenotype (Fig. 11I, J, O\\u2013Q). Misexpression of hNAT9 alone, (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009hNAT9) serves as another control and exhibits near normal eye imaginal disc and adult eye phenotype (Fig. 11E, F). Gain-of-function of hNAT9 in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009hNAT9) significantly rescues the A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegenerative phenotype as observed in the eye disc and adult eye (n\\u2009=\\u2009600, 528/600\\u2009=\\u200988%) (Fig. 8K, L, O\\u2013Q). In order to test if the acetyl transferase activity of hNAT9 functions in a similar fashion as Drosophila Mnat9, and is not required for its neuroprotective function in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background, we used transgenic flies where functional acetylation domain of hNAT9 was mutated. The motif was mutated in hNAT9 construct (hNAT9 [AAA]) by substituting alanine AxxAxA in the RxxGxG acetyl-CoA binding site [49]. The control GMR\\u2009>\\u2009hNAT9 [AAA] exhibit near wild-type eye discs (Fig. 11G) and adult eye phenotypes (Fig. 11H). Misexpression of hNAT9 [AAA] construct in the background of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009hNAT9 [AAA]) (n\\u2009=\\u2009600, 450/600\\u2009=\\u200975%) (Fig. 11M\\u2013Q) exhibit a significant rescue as compared to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 alone (Fig. 11I, J, O\\u2013Q). We also calculated frequency of phenotypes (Fig. 11O), severity of eye phenotype (Fig. 8P) and the surface area of eye (Fig. 11Q) in various background(s) discussed above. Based on these three parameters, we found that hNAT9 can significantly rescue the neurodegeneration as seen with Drosophila Mnat9. Taken together, these three parameters further validate that hNAT9 shows functional conservation to fly Mnat9 in its ability to modify A\\u03b242- mediated neurodegeneration phenotypes by downregulating the JNK signaling pathway, which is independent of the acetylation function of NAT9 (Fig. 11R).Fig. 11Mnat9 and human hNAT9 exhibit functional conservation.The eye imaginal discs which are stained with membrane specific marker, Discs large (Dlg; green), and a pan neural marker ELAV (red) to mark the nuclei of retinal neurons.

R Overexpression of A\\u03b242 in the fly eye (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242) results in accumulation of amyloid plaques extracellularly and causes aberrant activation of the JNK pathway resulting in a neurodegenerative adult eye phenotype. Overexpression of Mnat9 and hNAT9 in the background of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242, ameliorate A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration by downregulating JNK pathway, independent of its acetylation activity. We identified Mnat9 as a genetic modifier that rescues A\\u03b242-mediated neuronal cell death. N-acetylation is a post translational modification of proteins, and it takes place at the beginning of translation [47, 49]. Drosophila gene CG11539 encodes for a NAT family protein, Mnat9, which is related to human NAT9 [49]. Mnat9 acetylates the N-terminus of alpha and beta Tubulin, subunits of microtubules. Mnat9 is ubiquitously expressed at a basal level in the larval eye imaginal disc. RNA seq data from the Drosophila model organism Encyclopedia of DNA elements (modENCODE) indicates that Mnat9 is also expressed at a basal level in different stages of development [77]. Moreover, its expression is low/ basal level in all adult cell types as shown by Fly Atlas scRNA-seq [78]. This is the first study that reports the role of Mnat9 in modifying cell death observed in our Drosophila AD model. The phenotypic data strongly suggest that Mnat9 plays a role in downregulating neuronal cell death in AD-like neuropathology. Additionally, in AD, neurons die, and their guidance and targeting are impaired, which is an underlying cause of synaptic failure [71, 79, 80]. Axonal targeting defects, and neuronal dysfunction have been implicated in Drosophila AD model [8, 71, 81, 82]. We identified that Mnat9 can restore the axonal targeting of retinal neurons as evident from chaoptin staining. It has been reported that Mnat9 is necessary for the stabilization of microtubules [49]. Hence, Mnat9 rescues both phenotypic and the axonal targeting defects observed in AD. It is known that axonal misguidance or defective targeting in tissues results in neuronal cell death [80]. A similar mechanism may be involved in A\\u03b242 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242) accumulation, and has been reported earlier to trigger a severe neuronal cell death response [33, 71]. Based on our studies, Mnat9 may reduce this cell death and ROS production observed in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 model of AD in flies. Therefore, Mnat9 may be providing survival cues to the neurons that are expressing high levels of human A\\u03b242 polypeptides. Currently, Mnat9 is also known for its role in protecting cells from undergoing cell death by inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway [49]. Mnat9 catalyzes N-terminal acetylation of alpha- and beta- Tubulins of microtubules in vitro through its N-acetyltransferase domain. Interestingly, we found that N-terminal acetylation activity of Mnat9 in Drosophila might not be required for its neuroprotective function in A\\u03b242 plaques. We confirmed this in flies where the Acetyl-CoA binding site of both Drosophila Mnat9 and human hNAT9 was mutated. Surprisingly, the overexpression of mutated Mnat9 as well as hNAT9 exhibited a significant rescue in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies instead of enhancing the reduced eye phenotype. This finding suggests that acetylation defective Mnat9 is equivalently functional as wild-type Mnat9 in terms of its neuroprotective function in our AD model. Moreover, acetylated Tubulin levels were not significantly modulated when Mnat9 was overexpressed in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background. Our data suggests that N-terminal acetylation activity of Mnat9 is not required for preventing neurodegenerative phenotype of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies. Mnat9 belongs to the NAT family that stabilizes the microtubules. N-acetyltransferases are evolutionarily conserved. Drosophila Mnat9 and human hNAT9 exhibit approximately 54% DNA sequence identity and 49% protein identity respectively [49] and is expressed both in human brain and gonads [83]. Moreover, overexpression of human hNAT9 causes significant rescue in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies suggesting that Mnat9 and human hNAT9 are functionally conserved as well. Previously, it has been shown there is functional conservation of human NAT9 and Mnat9 in wing development [49]. Currently, the role of hNAT9 in humans is not clear. It was proposed that defective regulation of NAT9 may serve as a susceptibility factor for psoriasis (OMIM 177900), a chronic inflammatory skin disorder [84]. Furthermore, chronic inflammation has been increasingly linked to age related neurodegenerative disorders as well as other diseases like diabetes [85]. Our studies show that hNAT9 rescues GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 phenotype. Thus, there is a strong possibility that this interaction might extend to higher organisms as well. Mnat9 is the NAT family protein that regulates JNK signaling during development. Furthermore, knockdown of Mnat9 results in the aberrant activation of JNK signaling pathway [49]. In AD, accumulation of amyloid plaques leads to aberrant activation of the JNK signaling pathway resulting in cell death [8, 29, 30]. Therefore, we analyzed pJNK levels in eye imaginal discs when Mnat9 was overexpressed in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies and found significant decrease in pJNK levels. Our results also support that Mnat9 regulates JNK signaling pathway. Hence, our results indicate that gain-of-function of Mnat9 ameliorates the neurodegenerative phenotype of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 fly eye by downregulating JNK pathway. It would be interesting in the future to investigate the functional motifs that mediate JNK- Mnat9 interactions that likely underlie the genetic modifications observed in our AD studies. Our study explores the Mnat9-JNK interaction in AD, which presents an interesting opportunity of targeting AD progression by evaluating inhibitors of cell death signals (like JNK) downstream of amyloid plaques/ neurofibrillary tangles. This Mnat9-JNK interaction can modify cell death observed in AD. It would be interesting to explore if blocking JNK pathway by JNK inhibitor(s) can rescue the neurodegenerative phenotype caused by knockdown of Mnat9 in the background of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242. One of the physical interactors of hNAT9 is the mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6) identified by yeast two-hybrid system [86]. Moreover, MAPK6 is an interacting partner of c-Jun and regulates Activator Protein-1 (AP1) activity [87]. Since JNK signaling is involved in many functions during development, the chemical inhibition of this pathway may not be a useful strategy. Furthermore, misregulation of NAT9 may serve as a susceptibility factor for psoriasis and inflammation. hNATs have also been implicated in cancer but the role of NAT9 in cancer remains unknown. Based on the effects of genetic interactions between hNAT9 and Hippo signaling in the fly [50], it would be interesting to explore whether upregulation of hNAT9 is associated with high grade tumors [49]. Interestingly, we have shown that a positive feedback loop between Hippo signaling and JNK signaling pathway regulates A\\u03b242 mediated neurodegeneration [21, 29]. Thus, there is an interesting possibility that hNAT9 may be an attractive therapeutic target both in the context of cancer as well as neurodegenerative disorders. Our data suggest that Mnat9 and hNAT9 are functionally conserved. Interestingly, remodelin, a putative small molecule inhibitor of N-acetyl transferase 10 (NAT10), is a promising inhibitor which has shown preclinical efficiency in models of premature aging disease Hutchionson-Gilfords Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) [88]. Therefore, further exploration of human NAT9 (hNAT9) in mammalian model systems can help shed light on the etiology of AD as well as the potential role of hNAT9 as a druggable target of AD.

Most neurodegenerative diseases belong to protein misfolding disorders and, among them, Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) is the most prevalent. AD is characterized by accumulation of the amyloid-\\u03b242 (A\\u03b242) peptide in the extracellular space. Hence, we genetically engineered a molecular chaperone that was selectively delivered to this cellular location. It has been reported that the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) binds A\\u03b242 preventing self-aggregation. Here, we employed two isoforms of the Hsp70, cytosolic and extracellular, to evaluate their potential protective effect against the memory decline triggered by extracellular deposition of A\\u03b242. Both Hsp70 isoforms significantly improved memory performance of flies expressing A\\u03b242, irrespective of their age or the level of A\\u03b242 load. Using olfactory classical conditioning, we established a Drosophila model of AD based on A\\u03b242 neurotoxicity and monitored memory decline through aging. The onset of the memory impairment observed was proportional to the cumulative level of A\\u03b242 in the Drosophila brain. These data support the use of this Drosophila model of AD to further investigate molecules with a protective activity against A\\u03b242-induced memory loss, contributing to the development of palliative therapies for AD.\\n\\nFull Text: Proteinopathies, also known as protein misfolding disorders, are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by an initial self-association of misfolded proteins that eventually aggregate into toxic assemblies. Chaperone activity of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) has been reported to exert certain protective effects in some proteinopathies, including spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), Parkinson\\u2019s disease (PD) and Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD)1. Early in vitro studies are consistent with a regulatory role of chaperones in protein misfolding and aggregation2. Together, these findings lead to the hypothesis that molecular chaperones are cellular machines modulating pathology through control of protein folding/misfolding. Molecular chaperones are responsible for the proper folding and maturation of nascent proteins as well as the re-folding or degradation of misfolded ones. A large number of these chaperones are heat shock proteins (Hsps). These proteins were initially characterized for their response to heat shock stress, which is mostly regulated by gene expression via the heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1). Hsps trigger efficient responses against cellular stress3. Molecular chaperones can be found intracellularly (i.e.: Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsp90, Hsp100 and Hsp110) and extracellularly (i.e.: ST11, clustering and alpha-macroglobulin)4. In particular, the Hsp70 family of chaperones is known for its role in protein trafficking, folding of nascent proteins and re-folding or degradation of misfolded/aggregated proteins3,5. Functionally, Hsp70 display two domains, the substrate binding domain (SBD), which recognizes specific substrates or client proteins, and the nucleotide binding domain (NBD), which binds ATP and regulates client association through ATP hydrolysis. A short peptide links both domains and allows allosteric changes that modulate Hsp70 interaction with clients due to ATP/ADP cycles3. Whether Hsp70 is located extracellularly is not clear, but some reports claim both intracellular and extracellular roles for Hsp703,6,7. AD is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder; a dementia that particularly affects the aging population with a profound personal, medical and social impact. Hyperphosphorylated tau protein accumulation in intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NTFs) and amyloid-\\u03b21-42 (A\\u03b242) peptide deposition in extracellular plaques are the two major hallmarks of AD8. As the original amyloid cascade hypothesis postulates, accumulation of A\\u03b242 constitute the triggering event in AD9, and recent updates to this hypothesis indicate that pre-amyloid structures are the most toxic A\\u03b242 species10. Sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \\u03b2-secretase (BACE1) and \\u03b3-secretase produces the A\\u03b242 peptide, which is then secreted to the extracellular space. A\\u03b242 can also be internalized by re-uptake11 and endocytosis12. A\\u03b242, either directly in the cytosol or from the extracellular space through binding to specific receptors (i.e.: NMDA, AMP, nAChR and mGluR5), promotes activation of several kinases, which include CaMKK2, JunK and GSK312. These kinases eventually hyperphosphorylate tau, which has been proposed to be the executor of the pathogenic process, affecting synaptic function and leading to cognitive impairments. In Drosophila, a number of AD models replicate relevant features of AD and, some exhibit memory impairments due to overexpression of tau13\\u201315, hAPP, APP-like (APPL, the Drosophila orthologue of APP)16,17 or A\\u03b24218. Interestingly, ubiquitous expression of tau selectively affected the mushroom body (MB) neurons, which is consistent with the neuron-specific pathology of AD14,15. Furthermore, the mechanisms of memory formation seem to be more sensitive to expression of A\\u03b242 or A\\u03b240 than the mechanisms underlying locomotion, as memory deficits are observed in flies as young as 6 day-old, while locomotion remains unaltered until they reach the age of 20-day old18. In addition, expression of a human form of A\\u03b242 carrying the mutation associated with early-onset familial AD (E22G), EOFAD-related Arctic mutation (A\\u03b242Arc), induces an earlier onset of the memory deficiencies than that observed for wild type A\\u03b24219. This suggests that this memory assay, which employs olfactory classical conditioning in Drosophila, is particularly sensitive to clinically relevant variants of A\\u03b242. In recent years, Drosophila models of cognition have been established as a standard system to explore the learning and memory mechanisms at the molecular, cellular, and behavioral levels. Studies in the past 3 decades has unraveled important parallelisms between Drosophila and mammals concerning the anatomy of the olfactory pathway, the organization of neuronal circuits and the signaling cascades underlying the formation of memories20. The Drosophila MBs are a bilateral structure located in the dorsal region of the brain and comprised of approximately two thousand neurons in each brain hemisphere, the Kenyon Cells. The axons of these neurons project ventrally to form the MB lobes, where they connect with a plethora of post-synaptic neurons through the release of acetylcholine. The neuronal activity that Kenyon cells orchestrate plays a major role in the formation and storage of olfactory memories21\\u201323. The MB neurons in combination with the use of olfactory classical conditioning protocols are ideally suited to examine the effectiveness of novel therapeutic agents targeting the neurodegenerative actions of human amyloids, their efficiency, and functionality. As these amyloids are mostly secreted to the extracellular space, we engineered a molecular system that delivers a potential blocking agent, the Hsp70, to this extracellular region. We previously showed that secreted Hsp70 efficiently suppressed A\\u03b242 neurotoxicity through its holdase domain24. In that study, we monitored locomotor activity as the alternative physiological assay to evaluate neuronal activity. Although this method resulted effective in providing functional evidence, the paradigm was not relevant in the context of AD. Here, we thoroughly characterized the age-dependent memory decline of flies expressing A\\u03b242 in the MB neurons and determined that expression of the amyloid in the Drosophila brain progressively abolishes the formation of new memories. Using this sensitive behavioral assay, we also observed that the onset of these memory deficits was dose-dependent; the higher the level of A\\u03b242, the earlier the onset of the memory impairments. We then demonstrated that both cytosolic and secreted forms of Hsp70 fully restored memory acquisition in flies expressing A\\u03b242, irrespective of their age. Although these two forms may function through independent pathways, they both alleviated the memory decline caused by A\\u03b242 accumulation without affecting that associated with aging. Altogether, the data confirm the relevance of this Drosophila model of AD in evaluating A\\u03b242-induced memory impairments and in searching for protective molecules and compounds with a prospective therapeutic application. We had previously developed a Drosophila model of AD25, in which we specifically expressed the A\\u03b242 construct26 in the mushroom body (MB) neurons and monitored memory acquisition throughout aging, and up to 30 days of age. Our fly model displayed severe memory impairments after olfactory classical conditioning25. As memory was drastically impaired since day 1 post-eclosion, we decided to lower the expression level of the A\\u03b242 construct26 and monitor the progression of these memory deficits under these new conditions. Gal4 thermostability enables controlling the cumulative amount of Gal4 by temperature, with a maximal level being reached at the optimal temperature of 30\\u2009\\u00b0C27. Decreases in temperature from this optimal value reduce the level of Gal4 and, consequently, the transcriptional activity of the Gal4 over the UAS construct. Experiments carried out between 29\\u2009\\u00b0C and 30\\u2009\\u00b0C limited the amount of flies to perform these assays due to excessive lethality. Then, we tested whether a two-degree shift in temperature (27\\u2009\\u00b0C to 25\\u2009\\u00b0C) could lead to significant changes in the expression level of A\\u03b242. We detected a very small amount of A\\u03b242 in flies (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) raised at 25\\u2009\\u00b0C when compared to those developed at 27\\u2009\\u00b0C (Fig.\\u00a01a,b), while control lines carrying either the driver construct (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) or the effector element (UAS-A\\u03b242/+) alone did not trigger any expression of A\\u03b242. Hence, we evaluated memory acquisition in control flies (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) and flies expressing A\\u03b242 in the MBs (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) at 27\\u2009\\u00b0C and 25\\u2009\\u00b0C from day 1 to day 30 post-eclosion. In control flies, memory performance was statistically comparable at both temperatures (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a01). However, memory acquisition of flies expressing A\\u03b242 in the MBs became increasingly impaired as they aged at 25\\u2009C (Fig.\\u00a01c), but was consistently disrupted through all ages tested at 27\\u2009\\u00b0C (Fig.\\u00a01d). At the higher temperature of 27\\u2009\\u00b0C, memory acquisition was severely affected since day 1 post-eclosion and the level of impairment was maintained throughout all ages tested (Fig.\\u00a01d). This early phenotype was probably due to the high expression level of A\\u03b242 accrued during development (Fig.\\u00a01a,b). At 25\\u2009\\u00b0C, conversely, no memory deficits were observed until day 5 post-eclosion (Fig.\\u00a01c); in fact, memory performance of flies expressing A\\u03b242 at 25\\u2009\\u00b0C was not as impaired as in those at 27\\u2009\\u00b0C until 15 days of age (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a01). By this time, A\\u03b242 levels at 25\\u2009\\u00b0C were equivalent to those at 27\\u2009\\u00b0C at day 1 (Fig.\\u00a01e,f). Nonetheless, A\\u03b242 expression was consistently higher at 27\\u2009\\u00b0C throughout aging (Fig.\\u00a01e,f). By day 30, memory performance was drastically disrupted and at comparable levels irrespective of the temperature. Together, these results indicated that A\\u03b242 triggered a progressive cognitive decline whose onset is dependent on the amount of A\\u03b242.Figure 1A\\u03b242 expression level dictates the onset of memory impairments in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease.

Flies were tested immediately after conditioning.

Expression of the A\\u03b242 peptide in the MB neurons (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) enhances this memory decline (day 1 vs day 5, p\\u2009=\\u20090.1031; day 5 vs day 15, p\\u2009=\\u2009<\\u20090.0001; day 15 vs day 30, p\\u2009=\\u20090.2099), but does not significantly impair memory performance until day 5 (t-test comparison; day 1, p\\u2009=\\u20090.6056; day 5, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0123; day 15, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0071; day 30, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0015) and then significantly increases with age. (d) At 27\\u2009\\u00b0C, control flies show a memory decline associated with age that is slightly more pronounced at older ages, and this is significantly increased in flies expressing A\\u03b242 in the MB neurons (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) at all ages tested (t-test comparison; day 1, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001; day 5, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001; day 15, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0002; day 30, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001).

Expression of the A\\u03b242 peptide in the MB neurons (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) enhances this memory decline (day 1 vs day 5, p\\u2009=\\u20090.1031; day 5 vs day 15, p\\u2009=\\u2009<\\u20090.0001; day 15 vs day 30, p\\u2009=\\u20090.2099), but does not significantly impair memory performance until day 5 (t-test comparison; day 1, p\\u2009=\\u20090.6056; day 5, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0123; day 15, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0071; day 30, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0015) and then significantly increases with age. (d) At 27\\u2009\\u00b0C, control flies show a memory decline associated with age that is slightly more pronounced at older ages, and this is significantly increased in flies expressing A\\u03b242 in the MB neurons (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) at all ages tested (t-test comparison; day 1, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001; day 5, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001; day 15, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0002; day 30, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001).

(e) A\\u03b242 immunodetection at day 1, 5 and 15 post-eclosion in protein extracts from flies (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; ok107-Gal4/+) raised at 25\\u2009\\u00b0C or 27\\u2009\\u00b0C. (f) A\\u03b242 levels were normalized to the amount of \\u03b2-Tubulin in the matching groups, observing a correlation between temperature and the level of A\\u03b242 from day 1 to day 15 (n\\u2009>\\u20093). Interestingly, despite the severity in the cognitive impairments observed, no significant morphological alterations were found in the MBs of flies expressing A\\u03b242 at the macroscopic level (Fig.\\u00a02). At 27\\u2009\\u00b0C, however, the volume of the MB lobes (axonal) and, more prominently, the calyxes of the Kenyon Cells (somatic and dendritic) tended to shrink due to A\\u03b242-induced neurodegeneration; but this effect does not became significant until day 20 post-eclosion, as it was previously reported25. Remarkably, the memory impairments were present (i.e.: day 1 at 27\\u2009\\u00b0C and day 5 at 25\\u2009\\u00b0C) before any morphological defects became detectable (Fig.\\u00a02a,b,d,e).Figure 2The architecture of the mushroom body is preserved in flies expressing A\\u03b242.

The morphology of the MBs was analyzed in three-dimensional reconstructions of brains from flies raised at 25\\u2009\\u00b0C (a,c,e,g) and 27\\u2009\\u00b0C (b,d,f,h).

Given the drastic memory impairment observed in A\\u03b242 expressing flies (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+), we tested whether the sensory stimuli presented to these flies was properly perceived, as this is a requirement for memories to be formed. Otherwise, memory deficits would be the result of a disrupted perception rather than a deficiency in the formation of memories per se. Thus, it was critical to exclude the possibility that these memory impairments were the result of abnormalities in stimuli perception. We then assessed shock and odor acuity of flies expressing A\\u03b242 in the MBs and compared them to those of control flies. Avoidance indexes for an electric shock of 90\\u2009V (Table\\u00a01 and Supplementary Table\\u00a01) and the two odors, octanol (Table\\u00a02 and Supplementary Table\\u00a02) and benzaldehyde (Table\\u00a03 and Supplementary Table\\u00a03), at the same working concentrations used for conditioning, did not reveal significant differences between controls and A\\u03b242 expressing flies. Nonetheless, we observed a small tendency for flies expressing A\\u03b242 to have a lower sensitivity to these odors at day 5 (Supplementary Tables\\u00a02\\u20133). This was especially noticeable for benzaldehyde, in which case the tendency was present at day 30 as well (Supplementary Table\\u00a03). At day 15, however, shock and odor perception was identical to controls. Therefore, the memory impairments observed in flies expressing A\\u03b242 in the MB neurons (Fig.\\u00a01c,d) are caused by disruptions in the mechanism of memory formation rather than deficits in sensory perception.Table 1Shock avoidance of flies co-expressing the Hsp70 isoforms and A\\u03b242.Genotype90\\u2009V Shock Avoidance\\np-value\\nUAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+0.6744\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.0513\\u2014UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+0.6241\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.05990.9926UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-secHsp70; ok107-Gal4/+0.7034\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.06010.9998UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-cytHsp70; ok107-Gal4/+0.8012\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.04260.6946UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; +/+0.6592\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.0695>0.9999UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-secHsp70; +/+0.7891\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.03160.7823UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-cytHsp70; +/+0.7928\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.03360.7572UAS-secHsp70/+; ok107-Gal4/+0.7034\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.04290.9763UAS-cytHsp70/+; ok107-Gal4/+0.6893\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.02940.9458Avoidance to an electric shock of 90 Volts for each corresponding genotype and their Tukey\\u2019s comparison test p-value for statistical significance versus the control (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+).Table 2Odor avoidance for 3-octanol of flies co-expressing Hsp70 isoforms and A\\u03b242.GenotypeOctanol Avoidance\\np-value\\nUAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+0.8116\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.0121\\u2014UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+0.5096\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.10880.0530UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-secHsp70; ok107-Gal4/+0.8422\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.03600.9996UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-cytHsp70; ok107-Gal4/+0.7110\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.04930.8323UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; +/+0.7227\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.05390.8979UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-secHsp70; +/+0.8663\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.03520.9902UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-cytHsp70; +/+0.8873\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.01070.9502UAS-secHsp70/+; ok107-Gal4/+0.7852\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.03960.9483UAS-cytHsp70/+; ok107-Gal4/+0.7948\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.04030.9932Avoidance to the odor 3-octanol for each corresponding genotype and their Tukey\\u2019s comparison test p-value for statistical significance versus the control (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+).Table 3Odor avoidance for benzaldehyde of flies co-expressing the Hsp70 isoforms and A\\u03b242.GenotypeBenzaldehyde Avoidance\\np-value\\nUAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+0.3944\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.0805\\u2014UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+0.1420\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.11440.2999UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-secHsp70; ok107-Gal4/+0.1597\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.04890.3764UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-cytHsp70; ok107-Gal4/+0.2035\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.08030.3208UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; +/+0.0680\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.11930.0937UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-secHsp70; +/+0.2269\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.05520.7187UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-cytHsp70;+/+0.2765\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.05370.9160UAS-secHsp70/+; ok107-Gal4/+0.2837\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.07020.9483UAS-cytHsp70/+; ok107-Gal4/+0.3062\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.09260.9262Avoidance to the odor benzaldehyde for each corresponding genotype and their Turkey\\u2019s comparison test p-value for statistical significance versus the control (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gl4/+).

Once we analyzed the dynamics of the A\\u03b242-mediated memory decline in Drosophila, we tested the ability of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) to protect and/or prevent flies from the memory impairments caused by A\\u03b242 neurotoxicity. The Hsp70 is a molecular chaperone with demonstrated neuroprotective activity against intracellular amyloids that can also tackle extracellular targets through genetic engineering24. As A\\u03b242 is secreted to the extracellular space, we first employed the secreted form of the Hsp70 (secHsp70) at both previously tested temperatures, 25\\u2009\\u00b0C and 27\\u2009\\u00b0C. Flies developed at 25\\u2009\\u00b0C and co-expressing the secHsp70 and A\\u03b242 in the MB neurons (UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-secHsp70; ok107-Gal4/+) performed significantly higher than flies co-expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) at day 15 and 30 post-eclosion, and statistically equivalent to the corresponding control group (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) at day 1, 5, 15 and 30 post-eclosion (Fig.\\u00a03a). Although performance of flies co-expressing A\\u03b242 and secHsp70 was always equivalent to that of control flies, memory performance of flies co-expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ was also very similar to that of flies co-expressing A\\u03b242 and secHsp70 at day 1 and 5 (Fig.\\u00a03a). Given that the lower level of A\\u03b242 at this temperature led to a milder memory deficit (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a01), we next asked whether secHsp70 would protect against cognitive deficits triggered by a higher load of A\\u03b242.Figure 3Expression of the secreted Hsp70 prevents memory impairments in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Flies were raised at either 25\\u2009\\u00b0C (a) or 27\\u2009\\u00b0C (b\\u2013f) throughout development and up to day 1 (c), 5 (d), 15 (e) or 30 (f) post-eclosion and then trained using olfactory classical conditioning. Flies were tested immediately after conditioning. Memory performance index (P.I.) is shown for control flies (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+), flies expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) or in combination with the secreted form of Hsp70 (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-secHsp70/+; ok107-Gal4/+) and control flies without carrying the Gal4 driver (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+ and UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-secHsp70/+).

(b) At 27\\u2009\\u00b0C, expression of the secreted Hsp70 chaperone in the MB neurons rescues the memory deficits caused by A\\u03b242 deposition (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+ vs UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-secHsp70/+; ok107-Gal4/+; day 1, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001; day 5, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001; day 15, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001; day 30, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0002). Memory performance of flies expressing secHsp70 (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-secHsp70/+; ok107-Gal4/+) is equivalent to that of control flies (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) at all ages tested (day 1, p\\u2009>\\u20090.9999; day 5, p\\u2009=\\u20090.7065; day 15, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0529; day 30, p\\u2009>\\u20090.9999). (c) One-day-old flies expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ in the MB neurons display a significantly lower memory performance (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) than control flies expressing LacZ alone (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+).

(d) Five-day-old flies expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ in the MB neurons display a significantly lower memory performance (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) than control flies expressing LacZ alone.

Memory performance of flies expressing secHsp70 (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-secHsp70/+; ok107-Gal4/+) is equivalent to that of control flies (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) at all ages tested (day 1, p\\u2009>\\u20090.9999; day 5, p\\u2009=\\u20090.7065; day 15, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0529; day 30, p\\u2009>\\u20090.9999). (c) One-day-old flies expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ in the MB neurons display a significantly lower memory performance (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) than control flies expressing LacZ alone (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+). Flies co-expressing the secreted form of Hsp70 and A\\u03b242 (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-secHsp70/+; ok107-Gal4/+) performed at a significantly higher level than flies co-expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) and their memory performance was statistically undistinguishable from control flies (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+, p\\u2009>\\u20090.9999; UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+, p\\u2009>\\u20090.9999; UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-secHsp70/+, p\\u2009=\\u20090.7506). (d) Five-day-old flies expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ in the MB neurons display a significantly lower memory performance (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) than control flies expressing LacZ alone. Flies co-expressing the secreted Hsp70 and A\\u03b242 performed at a significantly higher level than flies co-expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) and their memory performance was statistically undistinguishable from control flies (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+, p\\u2009=\\u20090.7065; UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+, p\\u2009=\\u20099283; UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-secHsp70/+, p\\u2009=\\u20092109). (e) Fifteen-day-old flies expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ in the MB neurons display a significantly lower memory performance (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0003) than control flies expressing LacZ alone. Flies co-expressing the secreted Hsp70 and A\\u03b242 performed at a significantly higher level than flies co-expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) and their memory performance was statistically undistinguishable from control flies (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0529; UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+, p\\u2009=\\u20090.2066; UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-secHsp70/+, p\\u2009=\\u20090.3045). (f) Thirty-days-old flies expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ in the MB neurons display a significantly lower memory performance (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) than control flies expressing LacZ alone. Flies co-expressing the secreted form of Hsp70 and A\\u03b242 performed at a significantly higher level than flies co-expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ (p\\u2009=\\u20090.0002) and their memory performance was statistically undistinguishable from control flies (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+, p\\u2009>\\u20090.9999; UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+, p\\u2009=\\u20090.4083; UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-secHsp70/+, p\\u2009=\\u20090.5252).

We then performed the same experimental approach at 27\\u2009\\u00b0C. At this temperature, flies co-expressing the secHsp70 and A\\u03b242 in the MB neurons (UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-secHsp70; ok107-Gal4/+) performed significantly higher than flies co-expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+), and comparable to the respective control group (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) at day 1, 5, 15 and 30 post-eclosion (Fig.\\u00a03b). Further, memory acquisition of one- (Fig.\\u00a03c), five- (Fig.\\u00a03d), fifteen- (Fig.\\u00a03e) and thirty-day-old (Fig.\\u00a03f) flies co-expressing secHsp70 and A\\u03b242 was statistically equivalent to that of the corresponding control groups: flies expressing LacZ alone (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+), flies carrying the secHsp70 and A\\u03b242 (UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-secHsp70) transgenes or the A\\u03b242 (UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-LacZ) in the absence of Gal4 driver, and flies expressing the secHsp70 alone (UAS-secHsp70/+; ok107-Gal4/+) (Tables\\u00a04\\u20137).Table 4Tukey\\u2019s comparison test p-values at day 1.Genotypes1234567891\\n\\u2014\\n<0.0001>0.9999>0.99990.99940.85860.93050.05500.13392\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n<0.0001<0.0001<0.0001<0.0001<0.0001<0.0001<0.00013\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n>0.9999>0.99990.75060.97530.80280.79834\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n>0.99990.75370.98710.92890.79365\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n0.61560.99470.93460.85926\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n0.25000.85920.96577\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n0.85670.89768\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n0.53409\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u2014\\nTable shows p-values for memory performance between paired genotypes at day 1.

Additionally, electric shock avoidance (Table\\u00a01) and odor avoidance to octanol (Table\\u00a02) and benzaldehyde (Table\\u00a03) of flies co-expressing secHsp70 and A\\u03b242 and control flies carrying the secHsp70 and A\\u03b242 transgenes without Gal4 driver were both at the same level than those of the control group (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+), proving that secHsp70 and its combination with A\\u03b242 did not have effects in perception of the stimuli presented. Together, these results provided evidence of the protective effect of the secreted form of Hsp70 against the memory impairments caused by extracellular A\\u03b242 neurotoxicity. Regardless of the level of deleterious A\\u03b242 or the age of the individuals tested, secHsp70 was found to be an extraordinarily potent agent against A\\u03b242-mediated memory decline. The secreted form of Hsp70 contains a signal peptide that ensures delivery to the extracellular space, where it can meet A\\u03b242 and mask the associated neurotoxicity. However, we have previously found that the cytosolic Hsp70 also protected against A\\u03b242-induced neuronal death in flies24, and others found additional protective effects in mice6. In order to test whether the cytosolic Hsp70 prevents the memory impairments triggered by A\\u03b242 neurotoxicity, we next employed the cytosolic form of Hsp70 (cytHsp70) at both previously tested temperatures, 25\\u2009\\u00b0C and 27\\u2009\\u00b0C. At 25\\u2009C, flies co-expressing the cytHsp70 and A\\u03b242 in the MB neurons (UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-cytHsp70; ok107-Gal4/+) performed significantly higher than flies co-expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) at day 15 and 30 post-eclosion, and statistically equivalent to the corresponding control group (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) at day 1, 5, 15 and 30 post-eclosion (Fig.\\u00a04a). At this lower temperature of 25\\u2009\\u00b0C, the memory deficit of flies co-expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ were not significantly different from those of flies co-expressing A\\u03b242 and secHsp70 at day 1 and 5 (Fig.\\u00a04a). As the lower levels of A\\u03b242 at this temperature lead to a milder cognitive decline, with no memory deficit at day 1 and 5 (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a01), we then carried out the same experimental procedure at 27\\u2009\\u00b0C to test whether cytHsp70 protects against memory impairments triggered by a higher load of A\\u03b242.Figure 4Expression of the cytosolic Hsp70 prevents memory impairments in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Flies were raised at either 25\\u2009\\u00b0C (a) or 27\\u2009\\u00b0C (b\\u2013f) throughout development and up to day 1 (c), 5 (d), 15 (e) or 30 (f) post-eclosion and then trained using olfactory classical conditioning. Flies were tested immediately after conditioning. Memory performance index (P.I.) is shown for control flies (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+), flies expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) or in combination with the cytosolic form of Hsp70 (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-cytHsp70/+; ok107-Gal4/+) and control flies without carrying the Gal4 driver (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+ and UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-cytHsp70/+).

At the temperature of 27\\u2009\\u00b0C, flies co-expressing the cytHsp70 and A\\u03b242 in the MB neurons (UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-cytHsp70; ok107-Gal4/+) also performed significantly higher than flies co-expressing A\\u03b242 and LacZ (UAS-A\\u03b242/+; UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+), and comparable to the respective control group (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) at day 1, 5, 15 and 30 post-eclosion (Fig.\\u00a04b). Further, memory acquisition of one- (Fig.\\u00a04c), five- (Fig.\\u00a04d), fifteen- (Fig.\\u00a04e) and thirty-day-old (Fig.\\u00a04f) flies co-expressing cytHsp70 and A\\u03b242 was statistically equivalent to that of the respective control groups: flies expressing LacZ alone (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+), flies carrying the cytHsp70 and A\\u03b242 transgenes in the absence of Gal4 driver (UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-cytHsp70) or the A\\u03b242 transgene alone (UAS-A\\u03b242/UAS-LacZ), and flies expressing the cytHsp70 alone (UAS-cytHsp70/+; ok107-Gal4/+) (Tables\\u00a04\\u20137). Additionally, electric shock avoidance (Table\\u00a01) and odor avoidance to octanol (Table\\u00a02) and benzaldehyde (Table\\u00a03) of flies co-expressing cytHsp70 and A\\u03b242 and the control group carrying the cytHsp70 and A\\u03b242 transgenes without Gal4 driver were both at the same level than those of the control group (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+), demonstrating that cytHsp70 or its combination with A\\u03b242 had no effects in perception of the stimuli presented. These findings were consistent with previous studies in mice6 and provided evidence of the intracellular function that Hsp70 exerts protecting against the memory impairments caused by A\\u03b242 neurotoxicity. Together, the data presented here revealed an effective prevention of the A\\u03b242-triggered cognitive deficiencies via Hsp70 activity, from the cytosol as well as from the extracellular space, irrespective of the A\\u03b242 load or the age of the individuals affected. Hsp70 did exhibit full protection against the memory impairments induced by A\\u03b242 neurotoxicity. This protective effect was observed for both isoforms, the Hsp70 delivered to the extracellular matrix as well as the one delivered to the cytosol and, in some cases, memory performance of flies expressing the Hsp70 tended to be higher than that of control flies. Remarkably, this tendency was observed in a background of upregulated A\\u03b242, accumulating high loads of A\\u03b242 (Fig.\\u00a03e). For this reason, we decided to test the potential of Hsp70 to modulate memory formation in the absence of A\\u03b242. Performance of flies expressing the secHsp70 (UAS-secHsp70/+; ok107-Gal4/+) was equivalent to that of control flies (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) at day 1, 5, 15 and 30 post-eclosion (Fig.\\u00a05). Interestingly, Thirty-day-old flies did not show any sign of memory improvement when compare with their respective control group non-expressing secHsp70. These results indicated that, although secHsp70 protected against the memory deficits induced by A\\u03b242, it did not prevent the memory decline associated with aging. Similarly, performance of flies expressing the cytosolic form of Hsp70 (UAS-cytHsp70/+; ok107-Gal4/+) was also equivalent to that of control flies (UAS-LacZ/+; ok107-Gal4/+) at day 1, 5, 15 and 30 post-eclosion (Fig.\\u00a05). Again, the intracellular function of Hsp70 did not halt the progression of memory loss related to aging. Therefore, the holdase activity of Hsp70 either in the extracellular matrix or in the cytosol specifically prevented the development of memory deficits triggered by A\\u03b242 neurotoxicity without enhancing memory formation in young or old flies.Figure 5Cytosolic and secreted forms of Hsp70 do not enhance memory performance in young or elder flies. All genotypes were raised at 27\\u2009\\u00b0C.

Despite the tremendous advance experienced in the understanding of the AD pathogenesis, this knowledge has been sterile in developing therapies that efficiently reduce the symptoms of the disease. Two main molecular factors are responsible for triggering the disease: the microtubule associated protein tau, which is hyperphosphorylated and accumulates intracellularly in neurofibrillary tangles (NFT); and amyloid-\\u03b2 peptides, which aggregate extracellularly in plaques. Oligomers and protofibrils of A\\u03b242 have been proven to be the most toxic species10. Here we show that the onset and the degree of the cognitive impairments associated with AD are proportional to the cumulative expression level of A\\u03b242; the higher the level of A\\u03b242, the earlier the onset of the memory impairment. Remarkably, regardless of the severity observed for these memory deficits, we discovered that co-expression of the chaperone Hsp70 reverted the cognitive impairments to levels equivalent to those of control animals, supporting a potential application of this family of chaperones for palliative treatments of AD. As A\\u03b242 is mostly located in the extracellular space, we engineered a form of Hsp70 that was selectively delivered to this cellular location. Both Hps70s, cytosolic and secreted, protected against the neurotoxic effects of A\\u03b242 expression, restoring normal levels of memory. Based on these observations, it is possible to be facing two independent mechanisms of action for Hsp70, an intracellular clearance pathway6 and an extracellular masking effect24. On the one hand, Hsp70 exhibits a variety of functions in the extracellular space. STI1 is a co-chaperone of the Hsp70/Hsp90 machinery that is located in extracellular regions and triggers cytokine-like activity3. This machinery is responsible for activating stress responses. In fact, Hsp70 activates microglia, and increases expression of the insulin degrading enzyme (ide), which degrades \\u03b2-amyloids, and the tumor growth factor-\\u03b21 (tgf-\\u03b21) in astrocytes6. Upregulation of ide and tgf-\\u03b21 by Hsp70 has been shown to prevent the memory impairments associated with expression of APPsw in a mice model of AD and, as extracellular Hsp70 induces expression of tgf-\\u03b217, Hsp70 has been proposed to trigger this protective effect from the extracellular space6. Additionally, we have previously reported that the secreted form of Hsp70, genetically engineered to be delivered to the extracellular space, protects against neurodegeneration and cell death in a Drosophila model of A\\u03b242 neurotoxicity24. Given the (1) highly oxidizing environment and (2) low concentrations of ATP in the extracellular space4, and (3) the fact that the ATPase domain of the protein (foldase activity) was dispensable for these protective effects, we proposed that the activity of Hsp70 protecting against A\\u03b242 neurotoxicity was meditated by its holdase activity through direct binding to A\\u03b24224. This hypothesis suggests that Hsp70 binds A\\u03b242 and masks the neurotoxic epitopes in its assemblies, without involving the refolding activity of Hsp70 or degradation pathways. This activity then stabilizes small A\\u03b242 assemblies into nontoxic complexes, masking A\\u03b242 neurotoxicity and preventing its interaction with cellular substrates, which inhibits the ability of A\\u03b242 to disrupt membranes, penetrate cells, and spread to neighboring cells1,2,11. On the other hand, although A\\u03b242 is mainly secreted to the extracellular space, it can also be internalized by re-uptake11 and endocytosis12. Intracellular A\\u03b242 is highly toxic to synapses3,28\\u201330, which lead to synapse loss and eventual memory deficits. Therefore, cytosolic Hsp70 could also mediate its protective effect on memory loss through its holdase activity, a process that we previously postulated under the masking hypothesis24. This process involves Hsp70 binding to A\\u03b242 oligomers and preventing their deleterious effects24. The masking activity (holdase activity) of Hsp70 is independent of the foldase activity characteristic of folding/re-folding functions of the protein; however, under high concentrations of ATP as those in the cytosol, Hsp70 could also participate in the re-folding of misfolded and/or aggregated proteins, including A\\u03b242 and hyperphosphorylated tau. Following the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the expression of A\\u03b242 in the present model of AD could lead to hyperphosphorylation of tau, for which cytosolic Hsp70 could potentially prevent the formation of NFTs by binding and masking this aberrant form of tau. Hsp70 has also been involved in the regulation of macromolecular complexes and the control of protein-protein interactions3. Additionally, Hsp70 exerts a pleiotropic effect against cellular stress. The role of Hsp70 preventing oxidative stress, mitochondrial depolarization and cell death has been previously reported31. Hsp70 has also been reported to activate expression of ide and tgf-\\u03b2, which has been suggested to suppress the progression of AD6. Interestingly, overexpression of the wild type Hsp70, which is cytosolic, promotes production of IDE in astrocytes and microglia and TGF-\\u03b21 in astrocytes and neurons6. Although this is expected to occur through an intracellular mechanism, it was also suggested that Hsp70 would reach the extracellular space and trigger expression of tgf-\\u03b216. The present data suggest that the protective effects of Hsp70 operate through two main pathways: an intracellular pleiotropic effect that triggers expression of genes protecting against cellular stress, and an extracellular function by which Hsp70 binds and sequesters A\\u03b242 preventing its deleterious activities. The ability to independently manipulate intracellular and extracellular Hsp70s enabled discrimination of the differential effects that each of these molecular cascades exert on the various symptoms of AD. The cytosolic form seems to protect specifically against cell death and the synaptic effects underlying the loss of memory6 as we also show here. The secreted form, however, showed a broader effect that prevented neurodegeneration, as well as cell death and memory loss24, which is also presented here. Therefore, the data indicate that the different symptoms of AD exhibit a differential sensitivity to the intracellular and extracellular pathways. Although these two mechanisms occur in separate cellular compartments, they both seem to be intimately related as Hsp70 and A\\u03b242 are continuously transported in and out the cell. Together, the current findings prove the therapeutic potential of the chaperone Hsp70 against A\\u03b242 neurotoxicity and suggest the existence of multiple pathways leading to memory impairment in the context of AD. Further research identifying additional components of the protein quality control system will contribute to achieve a better understanding of the pathophysiology of AD and to develop more effective therapies to palliate AD symptoms. The data presented here support our Drosophila model of A\\u03b242-induced neurotoxicity as one ideally suited to investigate the synaptic mechanisms underlying the memory loss associated with AD. Fly stocks were raised on standard cornmeal media at 25\\u2009\\u00b0C. Flies carrying the UAS transgenes w; UAS-A\\u03b24226, w; UAS-secHsp7024 and w; UAS-cytHsp7024 were previously described. The Gal4 line ok107-Gal432 was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center at Indiana University (Bloomington, IN). Crosses between flies bearing the ok107-Gal4 driver and the different UAS lines or a combination of them were set at 25\\u2009\\u00b0C for 2 days and then either transferred to 27\\u2009\\u00b0C or kept at 25\\u2009\\u00b0C and 70% relative humidity on a 12\\u2009h light/dark cycle for development and aging until conditioning. Olfactory learning was assayed using olfactory classical conditioning procedures33. All behavioral experiments were performed under a dim red light at 26\\u2009\\u00b0C and 80% relative humidity. Groups of 50\\u201360 flies were transferred to small plastic tubes with a copper-grid floor to deliver the electric shock. A single cycle of training consisted of simultaneous presentation (CS+) for 60\\u2009sec along with shock pulses (1.25\\u2009sec) of 90\\u2009V (GRASS S48 Stimulator) every 5\\u2009sec, followed by the second odor presentation without associated shock (CS-) for another 60\\u2009sec. Odor presentations were separated by 30\\u2009sec of fresh air. For each N, two groups of flies of the same genotype were trained and tested simultaneously with the CS+ and CS- odors reversed. Benzaldehyde and 3-octanol were selected as the odor pairs. After training, the animals were tested immediately in a runway in which they chose between avoiding the CS+ or the CS- odor. Performance index (PI) was calculated by subtracting the number of flies avoiding the CS- odor from the number of flies avoiding the CS+ odor, divided by the total number of flies. The final PI score was calculated as the average of the two reciprocal half experiments with reversed odors. Flies stimulus perception was evaluated by their preference to avoid an electric shock of 90 volts or the odors, octanol and benzaldehyde, naively before conditioning. Each stimulus was presented independently to flies of the different ages and the corresponding genotype. Odor and shock avoidance were calculated by subtracting the number of flies avoiding the odor or shock from the number of flies avoiding mineral oil (the solvent for the odors), divided by the total number of flies. Proteins extracts were obtained from ten fly heads homogenized in 20\\u2009\\u03bcl of RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Samples were then incubated for 1\\u2009h at 55\\u2009\\u00b0C in monomerization buffer (9\\u2009M Urea, 1% SDS, 25\\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 1mMEDTA), and followed by centrifugation at 14.000\\u2009rpm for 2\\u2009mins. Supernatants were boiled for 5\\u2009mins in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and fractionated by SDS-PAGE in 12% Bis-Tris. Following transfer, 0.22\\u2009\\u03bcm nitrocellulose membranes were boiled in PBS for 5\\u2009mins and then probed against mouse monoclonal A\\u03b242 (6E10, 1:1000) and \\u03b2-Tubulin (1:1.000.000). After HRP-conjugated secondary antibody incubation, bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminiscence (ECL). Brains were dissected in cold PBS, and then fixed for 30\\u2009min in cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBST [0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS]. Fixed samples were washed and then mounted in Vectashield (Vector labs, USA) and observed on a Leica TCS-SP5 (Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with a motorized inverted microscope (Leitz DMIRE2). Serial optical sections (1024\\u2009\\u00d7\\u20091024 pixels) were taken at 2\\u2009\\u00b5m intervals using a 40X oil immersion objective. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (v5.0c). All data presented represent the mean\\u2009\\u00b1\\u2009the standard error of the mean (SEM). The sample size was 10 for each group unless otherwise stated. As PI values are normally distributed33\\u201335, parametric one-way ANOVA test followed by Tukey\\u2019s post-hoc or t-test comparisons were used for statistical analysis. Wilcoxon test was used to analyze significance from zero. The experiments described were approved by the Environmental Health and Safety Committee of the University of Florida. All the methods described were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. All data and resources described in this paper will be available upon request.

One of the reasons for AD is the accumulation of Amyloid-beta 42 (A\\u03b242) plaque(s) that trigger aberrant gene expression and signaling, which results in neuronal cell death by an unknown mechanism(s). Misexpression of human A\\u03b242 in the developing retina of Drosophila exhibits AD-like neuropathology. Small non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of their target genes and thereby regulate different signaling pathways. In a forward genetic screen, we identified miR-277 (human ortholog is hsa-miR-3660) as a genetic modifier of A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration. Loss-of-function of miR-277 enhances the A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration. Whereas gain-of-function of miR-277 in the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background downregulates cell death to maintain the number of neurons and thereby restores the retinal axonal targeting defects indicating the functional rescue. In addition, gain-of-function of miR-277 rescues the eclosion- and climbing assays defects observed in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background. Thus, gain-of-function of miR-277 rescues both structurally as well as functionally the A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we identified head involution defective (hid), an evolutionarily conserved proapoptotic gene, as one of the targets of miR-277 and validated these results using luciferase- and qPCR -assays. In the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background, the gain-of-function of miR-277 results in the reduction of hid transcript levels to one-third of its levels as compared to GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background alone. Here, we provide a novel molecular mechanism where miR-277 targets and downregulates proapoptotic gene, hid, transcript levels to rescue A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration by blocking cell death. These studies shed light on molecular mechanism(s) that mediate cell death response following A\\u03b242 accumulation seen in neurodegenerative disorders in humans and provide new therapeutic targets for neurodegeneration.\\n\\nFull Text: Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD), a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is highly prevalent in the elderly aged 65 or above. It is characterized by progressive neuronal loss, cognitive decline, and memory defects [1, 2]. Furthermore, AD has been reported to be a leading cause of death worldwide with no available cure to date. The presence of amyloid plaques and intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles are hallmarks of AD. Normally, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by \\u03b1-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase to form amyloid-beta 40 (A\\u03b240) peptide. However, if APP is sequentially cleaved by \\u03b2-secretase and \\u03b3-secretase, hydrophobic amyloid-beta 42 (A\\u03b242) peptides are formed. These A\\u03b242 monomers aggregate to form amyloid plaques and trigger the aberrant activation of signaling pathways and oxidative stress resulting in neuronal cell death [3\\u20135]. Recently the FDA has approved lecanemab, an anti-amyloid antibody that slows down the cognitive and functional decline in early-stage AD patients, according to a phase 3 clinical trial [6]. Thus, amyloid plaques target(s) are being pursued as potential therapeutic targets [6]. Since the genetic machinery is conserved, several vertebrate and invertebrate model systems are being developed and used to study AD pathology and underlying mechanism(s) [7\\u201311]. Invertebrate model system like Drosophila melanogaster can be easily genetically manipulated and offers a unique advantage to study the molecular mechanism(s) and pathogenesis of AD [11\\u201314]. The Drosophila eye has been extensively used for modeling neurodegenerative models like AD [13, 15\\u201317]. The adult compound eye, which develops from larval eye-antennal imaginal disc, is comprised of approximately 800 units called ommatidia. Each ommatidium consists of 8 photoreceptors and several support cells [17\\u201321]. The undifferentiated epithelial cells in the eye imaginal disc begin to differentiate into retinal neurons and other cell types at the late larval stage onto pupal development [18, 19]. Between 24h and 40\\u2009h after pupa formation (APF), any extra cells are eliminated through programmed cell death (PCD) to refine the hexagonal lattice [18, 19]. The precise organization of Drosophila eye makes it highly sensitive to genetic manipulations and allows quick screening of large sample size [21\\u201324]. Therefore, the Drosophila eye is employed to mimic many neurodegenerative disorders including AD and study the different signaling pathways as well as screen genetic modifiers and therapeutic targets for AD [13, 15, 25\\u201327]. Using the Gal4/UAS transgenic target system [28], human A\\u03b242 is spatiotemporally misexpressed in the differentiating photoreceptor neurons of the developing eye to mimic AD [15\\u201317]. This results in the accumulation of amyloid plaques exhibiting a progressive neurodegenerative phenotype in the Drosophila eye as compared to the wild-type eye, and thus phenocopies AD-like neuropathology [17, 26]. Therefore, the Drosophila eye model, due to repertoire of genetic tools, can be exploited for genome-wide screening to identify genetic modifiers of AD-like neuropathology. Accumulation of A\\u03b242 plaques triggers cell death, which is the primary cause of neurodegeneration in AD [29]. The proapoptotic factor head involution defective (hid) along with other caspases like Dronc, Drice, and Dark are involved in regulating PCD during pupal eye development [19]. In Drosophila, upon apoptotic stimuli, three proapoptotic genes: head involution defective (hid), reaper (rpr) and grim (grim) are expressed and thereby trigger cell death by inhibiting Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis (DIAP1) [30\\u201332]. Upon DIAP1 degradation, initiator caspase: Dronc (caspase 9) as well as effector caspase: Drice (caspase 3) are activated. This activation of the caspase cascade results in cell death. Caspase-dependent cell death can be prevented by high levels of baculovirus protein P35 [33]. Cell death observed in various human diseases is an outcome of aberrant signaling due to abnormal gene expression. Complex gene regulatory mechanisms control the expression of genes during development. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression of different signaling pathways [34]. Recent findings indicate that miRNAs play a crucial role in modulating multiple signaling pathways associated with various diseases [35]. These miRNAs confer specificity to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) through partial sequence complementarity with specific mRNA targets. Recruitment of miRNA and the RISC complex mostly results in repression of the target mRNA by an increase in turnover and/or translational inhibition. miRNAs regulate many biological events, including growth, development, differentiation, and neurodegenerative processes [36, 37]. Therefore, we hypothesized that miRNAs could regulate the expression of genes, which are members of signaling pathways that are involved in AD. In a forward genetic screen using candidate miRNAs, we screened for potential genetic modifiers of A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration phenotype. The rationale of the screen was to individually co-express a microRNA transgene along with GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 in the developing retina, and to screen for modifiers of the neurodegenerative phenotype. In this screen, we identified miR-277 as a potential miRNAs genetic modifier using the Drosophila eye model. Here, we report that upregulation of miR-277 rescues A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration phenotype whereas downregulation of miR-277 enhances A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegenerative phenotype of reduced eye with glazed surface. Furthermore, we have identified hid mRNA as a target of miR-277 using bioinformatics, genetic and molecular approaches. Here, we present an insight on the underlying mechanism of how miR-277 ameliorates A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration by regulating proapoptotic gene, hid, transcript levels and demonstrate the novel neuroprotective role of miR-277 in AD neuropathology. The fly stocks used in this study are listed in Flybase (http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu). Stocks used in this study are GMR-Gal4 [38], Elav-Gal4 [39], OK107-Gal4 [40, 41], UAS-A\\u03b242 [42], UAS miR-277, miR-277 mutant generated by TALEN editing, Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277-34-KO (BL#58908), GMR-hid; GMR-Gal4, GMR>rpr, GMR>grim, hid5\\u2019FWT-GFP [43]. The UAS-A\\u03b242 transgenic flies were generated by microinjecting a UAS-construct where two tandem copies of human amyloid\\u2014\\u03b21-42 (A\\u03b242) fused to signal peptide for secretion were cloned [44, 45]. The rationale of bi-cistronic construct was to mimic APP duplications associated with early onset of familial AD and to express high levels of A\\u03b242 to induce strong eye phenotype. We employed the transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) system for gene editing [46] to generate miR-277 mutant lines. A 150 base pairs of flanking sequences that surrounded miR-277 mature sequences were selected and added to the TALE-NT website (https://tale-nt.cac.cornell.edu/about) for designing target sites pairs for TALENs binding and editing [47, 48]. One pair of TALEN target sites, TALEN-miR-277-L_5\\u2032-GAAACTATCTGAAGCAT-3\\u2032 and TALEN-miR-277-R_5\\u2032-TCTGGAATGTCGTACC-3\\u2032, was chosen for the TALEN plasmids generation. The TALEN plasmids were synthesized by ZGENEBIO Biotech Inc. The midi-scale of TALEN plasmids was prepared by following the QIAGEN Plasmid Midi Kit (QIAGEN, #12145) and then transferred to BestGene Inc for Drosophila embryo injection services. After embryo microinjection, all the G0 adults were crossed with stubble (TM3) balancer strains by combining one male and one female to generate the individual family. From each family, 15 G1 offspring were randomly picked up to establish the homozygous subfamily strains for mutant line screening. Genomic DNA isolations and PCR reactions were performed using the published protocol [49]. The primer pairs used for PCR reaction and Sanger sequencing are mentioned in Table 1.Table 1The list of primer pairs used for PCR reaction and Sanger sequencing.NameSequenceTALEN_miR-277 Screening F1TTGGAGTTGCACCTTCGATTTCTGTTALEN_miR-277 Screening R1TATACAGTTGAAAACTCTTCATAGATALEN_miR-277 F1R1-PCR seq-FAGCCATCCAGGAGATCGATATALEN_miR-277 F1R1-PCR seq-RCAGTGTCTTACAAACAAGTGGDeshpande et al.

A 500 base pairs of DNA fragment that included miR-277 stem-loop precursor with each 200 base pairs of up and downstream flanking sequences were amplified from genomic DNA using the miR-277 specific primer set (Table 2). The miR-277 fragment was cloned into NotI/XhoI sites of the pTub-miR plasmid (gift from Dr. Stephen M. Cohen) to generate the pTub-miR-277 plasmid.Table 2The list of primer pairs used to generate the pTub-miR-277 plasmid.NameSequencemiR-277_NotI-FGGCGCGGCCGCTTGGAGTTGCACCTTCGATTTCTGTmiR-277_XhoI-RGGCCCTCGAGTATACAGTTGAAAACTCTTCATAGADeshpande et al.

The genetic crosses were maintained at 25\\u2009\\u00b0C, while the egg-lays were transferred to 29\\u2009\\u00b0C for further growth. Misexpression of A\\u03b242 in the differentiating retina (GMR-Gal4\\u2009>\\u2009UAS-A\\u03b242) exhibits a stronger neurodegenerative phenotype at 29\\u2009\\u00b0C with no penetrance [38]. GMR-Gal4 directs the expression of transgenes in the differentiating retinal precursor cells of the developing eye imaginal disc and pupal retina [38]. All crosses with Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277-34-KO (BL#58908) stock are mentioned as Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277KO. The adult flies of similar age from both sexes were stored at \\u221220\\u2009\\u00b0C for approximately 2\\u2009h for imaging. After the incubation, the flies were mounted on a dissection needle. It was placed horizontally over a glass slide using clay putty. The adult eye was imaged on the Axiomager.Z1 Zeiss Apotome and the Z-stacks were obtained [42, 50]. The final images were generated by compiling individual stacks from the Z section using the extended depth of focus function of Axiovision software version 4.6.3. For each genetic cross, three independent sets of two hundred flies were screened (200\\u2009\\u00d7\\u20093\\u2009=\\u2009600) and the frequency of eye phenotype(s) was calculated [51]. The eye phenotypes were categorized as severely reduced eye, reduced eye, and rescue of neurodegenerative phenotype. Graphs were plotted in GraphPad Prism. We examined the eye phenotypes from 200 flies per genotype and these flies were selected for scoring according to the following criteria: \\u201cNo-eye\\u201d was assigned to category 6, 80% eye degeneration was assigned to category 5, 60\\u201380% eye degeneration was assigned to category 4, 40\\u201360% eye degeneration was assigned to category 3, 20\\u201340% eye degeneration was assigned to category 2, 0\\u201320% eye degeneration was assigned to category 1 and wild-type was assigned to category 0 [51]. Comparisons were made using non-parametric: Mann\\u2013Whitney t test and graphs were plotted in GraphPad Prism. The adult eye images were opened in Image J software, and region of interest (ROI) was drawn and represented as yellow dotted line. We measured the surface area of the eye of five flies per genotype by using Image J software and plotted graph in GraphPad Prism. Eye-antennal imaginal discs were dissected from the third instar larvae in cold 1\\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1\\u00d7 PBS for 20\\u2009min, and then quickly washed once in 1\\u00d7 PBS. It was followed by three washes in 1\\u00d7 PBST. The tissues were stained with a combination of antibodies following a previously published protocol [42, 52]. The primary antibodies used were rat anti-Embryonic Lethal Abnormal Vision (ELAV) (1:100; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, DSHB), mouse anti-Discs-large (Dlg) (1:100; DSHB), and mouse anti-Chaoptin (24B10) (1:100; DSHB) [53]. Secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratory) used were goat anti-rat IgG conjugated with Cy5 (1:250), and donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Cy3 (1:250). The tissues were mounted in the antifading agent: Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). The immunofluorescent images were captured at 20\\u00d7 magnification by using Olympus Fluoview 3000 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope [54]. All final figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop software. Apoptosis was detected by using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay detection kit from Roche Diagnostics. TUNEL assay labels the DNA fragments in dying cells. This protocol involves labeling DNA breakage by adding fluorescently labeled nucleotides to free 3\\u2032-OH DNA ends in a template-independent manner using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). The fluorescein labels (TMR red) incorporated in nucleotide polymers can be detected by fluorescence microscopy [32, 55]. After secondary-antibody staining, eye-antennal discs were blocked in 10% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBST) and labeled for TUNEL assays using a cell-death detection kit from Roche Diagnostics. The TUNEL positive cells were counted from five sets of imaginal discs per genotype and were used for the statistical analysis using Microsoft Excel 2013 [56]. The graphs were plotted in GraphPad Prism, the p values were calculated using student\\u2019s t test, and the error bars represent standard error of mean (SEM). The symbols above the error bar signify *p value\\u2009<\\u20090.05, **p value\\u2009<\\u20090.01, ***p value\\u2009<\\u20090.001. Early white pre-pupae per genotype were selected and kept on a moist kim-wipe in a petri plate. After 48\\u2009h of collection of pre-pupae, pupal retina was dissected in cold 1\\u00d7 PBS carefully from the pupa. The retinae were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1\\u00d7 PBS for 20\\u2009min, and then washed once in 1\\u00d7 PBS. It was followed by three washes in 1\\u00d7 PBST. The dissection, washing, and antibody staining was done in nine well plate. The tissues were stained with a combination of antibodies following a previously published protocol [42, 52]. The primary antibodies used were rat anti-Embryonic Lethal Abnormal Vision (ELAV) (1:100; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, DSHB), and mouse anti-Discs-large (Dlg) (1:100; DSHB). Secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratory) used were goat anti-rat IgG conjugated with Cy5 (1:250), and donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Cy3 (1:250). The tissues were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). The immunofluorescent images were captured at \\u00d760 magnification by using Olympus Fluoview 3000 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope [54]. All final figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop software. The pupal retina was opened in Image J and ROI of 500px\\u2009\\u00d7\\u2009500px was drawn and the number of photoreceptor cells and the number of pigment cells were counted within the ROI, respectively. The five sets of pupal retinae per genotype were used for statistical analysis using Microsoft Excel. The graphs were plotted in GraphPad Prism. The p values were calculated using student\\u2019s t test, and the error bars represent standard error of mean (SEM) *p value\\u2009<\\u20090.05, **p value\\u2009<\\u20090.01, ***p value\\u2009<\\u20090.001. The third instar larval eye-antennal imaginal discs were dissected in cold 1\\u00d7 Schneider\\u2019s Drosophila medium (Gibco, Cat. #21720024). The samples were incubated in Dihydroethidium (DHE, Life Technologies Cat. # D11347) dye solution [(1:300) in 1\\u00d7 PBS] [57, 58] for 5\\u2009min and were washed three times with cold 1\\u00d7 PBS. The eye discs were then mounted on a slide and were immediately imaged on a Laser Scanning Confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview 3000) [54]. All final figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop software. The number of ROS puncta were quantified from five sets of imaginal discs per genotype by using automated quantification method [58]. The Interactive H watershed plugin of Image J/Fiji free software was used for automated quantification and the statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel [58]. The p values were calculated using student\\u2019s t test, and the error bars represent the standard error of mean (SEM) *p value\\u2009<\\u20090.05, **p value\\u2009<\\u20090.01, ***p value\\u2009<\\u20090.001. The 3\\u2032UTRs of three apoptosis-related genes, hid, dark, and drice, were amplified from genomic DNA of W[1118] strain with the following gene-specific 3\\u2032UTR primer pairs (Table 3).Table 3The list of primer pairs used to generate three luciferase reporter plasmids.Primer nameSequencehid_3\\u2032UTR-FGCCGTGTAATTCTAGAAAGCGCAGGAGACGTGTAATCGAATGATCTAThid_3\\u2032UTR-RAGGTCGACCTCGAGGCCTTTTACACATACACATAGATGTATTCATATAdark_3\\u2032UTR-FGCCGTGTAATTCTAGACGCCAGAAGTGCGTCCCTAGGCGGdark_3\\u2032UTR-RAGGTCGACCTCGAGGCCTGTGTTTTTCGTGAAATGTCGTTTATTTGGTdrice_3\\u2032UTR-FGCCGTGTAATTCTAGATGGCTAATGGTATGGATCAAACGGdrice_3\\u2032UTR-RAGGTCGACCTCGAGGCCTTGTTTTCAATCGGATTTATTAGCGGTTADeshpande et al.

The 3\\u2032UTR DNA fragments were individually cloned into the XbaI/StuI sites of the pTub-ffluc reporter plasmid (gift from Dr. Stephen M. Cohen) to generate three luciferase reporter plasmids, pTub-ffuc-hid, pTub-ffuc-dark and pTub-ffuc-drice, by In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Clontech, 639646). The luciferase reporter gene assay has recently been adapted to test whether a certain mRNA is the target for a specific miRNA [59]. The day prior to transfection, Drosophila Schneider S2 (S2) cells were seeded at a density of 1\\u20131.5\\u2009\\u00d7\\u2009106 cells per well in 12-well plate in Schneider\\u2019s Drosophila medium (SDM) (Gibco, Cat. #11720034) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Cat. #A3160402) and 1\\u00d7 penn/strep (Invitrogen, Cat. #15070-063). Before transfection, cells were washed with SDM only and changed the cultured medium into SDM (300\\u2009\\u03bcl/well) only without serum and penn/strep for 1\\u2009h. The diluted plasmid reagent was prepared by mixing the following plasmids, 100\\u2009ng of pTub-rLuc (gift from Dr. Stephen M. Cohen), 100\\u2009ng of pTub-ffLuc luciferase reporter (containing 3\\u2032UTR sequence of the target gene), and 1\\u2009\\u03bcg of pTub-miR-277 with 100\\u2009\\u03bcl SMD for each well. The diluted Cellfectin (Invitrogen, 10362-010) reagent was prepared by adding 5\\u2009\\u03bcl Cellfectin in 100\\u2009\\u03bcl SDM for each well and wait for 5\\u2009min. The diluted Cellfectin was mixed with diluted plasmids and waited for 30\\u2009min. The mixture was added to cells for 4\\u20136\\u2009h transfection reaction, and then medium was changed into SDM with 10% FBS and 1\\u00d7 penn/strep. The pTub-miR-1 (gift from Dr. Stephen M. Cohen) was performed at the same time in each transfection for negative control [60]. After 48-hour transfection, cells were lysed to detect the luciferase activities by using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, E1910). Renilla luciferase activity provided normalization for firefly luciferase activity. The value of relative luciferase activities of the different pTub-ffLuc-3\\u2032UTR constructs was calculated from the normalization of the luciferase activities of miR-1. The targeting effect of miR-277 on the luciferase gene expression can be shown as the relative luciferase activity. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed according to the standardized protocol [61, 62]. Total RNA was extracted in 500\\u2009\\u03bcl of TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher, Cat. No. # 15596926) from twenty pairs of third instar larvae eye-antennal imaginal discs (n\\u2009=\\u200940), which were dissected from GMR-Gal4, GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242, GMR>miR-277, GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+ miR-277, GMR>miR-277 mutant, GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+ miR-277 mutant, GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277KO and GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277KO. The quality of isolated RNA was determined by using the Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). The quality of samples was checked by A260/A280 ratio which were >2. cDNA was produced from total RNA through RT-PCR using the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (GE healthcare, Cat# 27926101). RT-qPCR was performed using iQ\\u2122 SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and Bio-Rad iCycler (Bio-Rad) following the kit\\u2019s protocol for 25\\u2009\\u03bcl. Primers used for hid were: (fwd: CCACCGACCAAGTGCTATAC; rev: CGGCGGATACTGGAAGATTT). Primers used for miR-277 were: (fwd: GCGTGTCAGGAGTGCATTT; rev: GTACGTTCTGGAATGTCGTACC). The expression level of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (fwd: CAATGGATTTGGTCGCATCG; rev: CCGTTGACCACCAGG AAACC) was used as an internal control to normalize the results. The fold change was calculated relative to the expression level of the respective control using delta deltaCT (\\u0394\\u0394CT) method [61]. Eclosion assays are used for screening the effects of various genetic backgrounds on eclosion of flies. We used Elav-Gal4 line to drive the expression of A\\u03b242 and other transgene in the central nervous system [39]. We collected eggs on a grape plate from Elav-Gal4 (control), Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242, Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+ miR-277, Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009miR-277 mutant and Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277KO. We seeded the first instar larvae (30 in each set) from a synchronous culture in each vial. 270 larvae (9 sets of 30 larvae) were counted for each cross. The larvae were allowed to develop to adulthood, and the eclosion rate [42] was counted. All unhatched pupae were also counted. The graph was plotted in GraphPad Prism. Climbing assays were performed to characterize the locomotor dysfunction. We used OK107-Gal4 line to drive the expression of A\\u03b242 and other transgene in the larval mushroom body as well as in adult mushroom body lobes [40, 41]. Since, Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies were lethal, we used OK\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies for detecting if miR-277 can affect the locomotor defects observed in AD flies. Flies were aged from 1 to 30 days in the regular food. Groups of 10 flies per genotype were transferred into cylindrical glass tube after anesthetization and left for 5-10\\u2009min for the revival and acclimatization at room temperature. Tubes were marked at 10\\u2009cm above the bottom of the vial. After acclimatization, the flies were gently tapped down to the bottom of vial, and the number of flies that crossed the 10\\u2009cm mark were recorded after 10\\u2009sec. Three trials were performed, and numbers were then averaged, and the resulting mean was used as the overall value for each single group of flies. For all genotypes, three replicates were carried out. Drosophila larval eye imaginal disc (Fig. 1A) develops into an adult compound eye comprising around 800-unit eyes called ommatidia (Fig. 1B). Note that the eye imaginal disc is stained for membrane-specific marker- discs large (Dlg, green) and pan neural marker- embryonic lethal abnormal vision (Elav, red) (Fig. 1A, C, E, G, I, K, M, O, Q). The GMR-Gal4 driver flies have wild-type adult eye (Fig. 1D) and eye imaginal discs (Fig. 1C). Misexpression of human A\\u03b242 in the differentiating retinal neurons of the developing eye by using GMR-Gal4 driver (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242), results in a progressive neurodegenerative phenotype with increased spaces in the photoreceptors mostly at the posterior margin of the eye disc (Fig. 1E), which further worsens in the adult eye as evident from the reduced eye size, disorganized and fused ommatidia in the adult eye (Fig. 1F). The progressive neurodegenerative phenotype of highly reduced adult eye has 100% penetrance (n\\u2009=\\u2009600, 600/600\\u2009=\\u2009100%) (Fig. 1F, S, T, U) [17]. In a forward genetic screen (Supplementary Figure 1), we identified miRNA\\u2212277 (miR-277) as the modifier of the neurodegenerative phenotype of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 (Fig. 1M, N, S, T, U). Misexpression of miR-277 alone (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009miR-277) serves as a control and exhibits near-normal eye phenotype in the eye imaginal disc and adult eye (Fig. 1G, H).

The orientation of all imaginal discs is identical with posterior to the left and dorsal up. Scale bar\\u2009=\\u2009100\\u2009\\u03bcm. To further validate our hypothesis, we investigated the loss-of-function of miR-277 by using miR-277 mutant (Fig. 1I, J) generated by TALEN system (Supplementary Figure 2A\\u2013C) or a deficiency, Df(3\\u2009R) miR-277KO that knocks out miR-277 function [GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277KO; Fig. 1K, L] in GMR-Gal4 background. Interestingly, loss-of-function of miR-277 in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+ miR-277 mutant) enhances the neuronal loss and hence show reduced eye phenotype (Fig. 1O, P, S, T, U) (Supplementary Figure 2) as compared to the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 alone (Fig. 1F). The severity of the phenotype is more in frequency with Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277KO (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277KO) (n\\u2009=\\u2009600, 333/600\\u2009=\\u200955.5%) (Fig. 1S) than with the molecular mutant (n\\u2009=\\u2009600, 306/600\\u2009=\\u200951%) (Fig. 1S). Moreover, gain-of-function of miR-277 in the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies significantly suppressed the neurodegenerative phenotype (Fig. 1T) and increased the surface area of the eye (Fig. 1U). This further validates our findings from the forward genetic screen that miR-277 is a genetic modifier of A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration in the Drosophila eye. We further quantitated the miR-277 transcript levels by qPCR and found that miR-277 levels were reduced to half in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background as compared to the control, GMR-Gal4. Furthermore, miR-277 levels were increased by 2.5 folds in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+ miR-277 background as compared to the control (Fig. 1V). Thus, our data suggest that a reduction in miR-277 levels triggers neurodegenerative response. In AD, neurons die due to the deposition of amyloid plaques. Since miR-277 can rescue the reduced eye phenotype of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242, we investigated if miR-277 can rescue the functionality of the neurons. One of the facets of the neurodegenerative phenotypes in retinal neurons is the disruption of axonal transport due to impaired axonal targeting and guidance from retinal neurons to the brain. We used Chaoptin (24B10, DSHB), a reliable marker for axonal targeting that marks the photoreceptor neurons and their axons [53]. During the late third instar eye imaginal disc, R1-R6 axons of each ommatidium project to the lamina, whereas R7 and R8 axons project to the medulla, a separate layer of the optic lobes [16, 63]. We counted a total of n\\u2009=\\u200950 eye discs per genotype, and frequency of eye discs indicating rescue of axonal targeting from GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 was recorded (Fig. 2A\\u2013J). The wild-type (n\\u2009=\\u200950) 100% (Fig. 2A, J) and GMR-Gal4 (n\\u2009=\\u200950) 100% (Fig. 2B, J) eye imaginal discs showed similar axonal projections in the brain. In comparison to the controls, GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 imaginal discs exhibit severe defects in axonal targeting, which contributes to the neurodegenerative phenotype in AD (Fig. 2C, J) [16, 64]. Misexpression of miR-277 in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+ miR-277; Fig. 2G, J) background, significantly restored the axonal targeting in comparison to the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 (Fig. 2C, J). However, GMR> miR-277 (Fig. 2D), or GMR>miR-277 mutant (Fig. 2E), or GMR\\u2009>\\u2009Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277KO (Fig. 2F) alone did not show any axonal targeting defects. The axonal targeting was further impaired or worsened when miR-277 levels were downregulated in the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background by either miR-277 mutant (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 + miR277 mutant, Fig. 2H, J) or by Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277KO (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277KO, Fig. 2I, J). This evidence suggests that upregulating the levels of miR-277 restores the axonal targeting defects, as seen in the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background. It has been shown that impaired axonal targeting is associated with neuronal cell death. Therefore, we tested the effects of modulation of miR-277 in cell death in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background.Fig. 2Gain-of-function of miR-277 can restore axonal targeting impaired by A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration.Chaoptin (24B10) marks the photoreceptors and their neurons.

Fluorescein-dUTP is transferred by the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotides transferase (TdT) at 3\\u2019OH where single or double-strand breaks occur during apoptosis [55, 56]. The TUNEL-positive cells were counted within yellow dotted ROI from five imaginal discs of each genotype and were used for statistical analysis. A few cells undergo cell death in the wild-type eye imaginal disc (Fig. 3A, J), whereas the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 eye imaginal disc shows significantly increased TUNEL positive nuclei (Fig. 3C, J).

There is a slight increase in TUNEL-positive nuclei in case of deficiency of miR-277 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277KO; Fig. 3I, J) as compared to the miR-277 mutant (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+ miR-277 mutant; Fig. 3H, J).

To investigate further if miR-277 can inhibit apoptosis during later stages of development, we performed pupal retina staining at 48\\u2009h after pupa formation (APF). During late larval development, the photoreceptor and cone cells are determined, following which the interommatidial cells (IOC\\u2019s) are specified to become pigment cells. Interommatidial (or pigment cells) surround the centrally located photoreceptor and cone cells, generating a precise, repeating hexagonal structure (ommatidium), which can be visualized during the pupal stage. This hexagonal lattice is formed due to programmed cell death (PCD), which occurs during 24\\u201340\\u2009h APF to eliminate extra interommatidial cells [18, 65]. We dissected the pupal retina at 48\\u2009h APF, when PCD was over. The number of photoreceptor nuclei and pigment cells from five individual areas was selected from five different pupal retinae for each genotype for analysis. The control GMR-Gal4 shows hexagonal arrangement of ommatidia and a monolayer of secondary and tertiary pigment cells (Fig. 4A, E, F). In contrast, the basic ommatidial organization is disrupted in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 pupal retina due to cell death, which results in the fusion of photoreceptors among neighboring ommatidia as evident from ELAV staining that marks the photoreceptor nuclei (Fig. 4B, E). In addition, the membrane of primary and secondary pigment cells is lost, as marked by Dlg (Fig. 4B, F). We observed multiple layers of secondary and tertiary pigment cells resulting in extra pigment cells when miR-277 was misexpressed in the GMR domain (GMR>miR-277; Fig. 4C, F). Since miR-277 is an anti-apoptotic miRNA, in GMR>miR-277 background, extra IOC\\u2019s accumulate between the ommatidia of the pupal retina as programmed cell death is inhibited. Interestingly the disruption of cell membrane, number of pigment cells, and fused ommatidia were significantly restored to near wild-type when miR-277 was misexpressed in the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+miR-277; Fig. 4D\\u2013F). Therefore, these results further validated our hypothesis that higher levels of miR-277 suppress the neurodegenerative phenotype of A\\u03b242 aggregate accumulation. Hence, miR-277 could be an anti-apoptotic miRNA. It has been previously reported that A\\u03b242 aggregate triggers the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [58, 66, 67].Fig. 4Gain-of-function of miR-277 downregulates cell death and plays a role in growth.Pupal retinae were stained with Discs large (Dlg) which marks the membrane (green), and a pan neural marker ELAV (red) which marks photoreceptors.

The accumulation of amyloid plaques triggers oxidative stress in the neurons resulting in an imbalance in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defense mechanism [17, 58, 68, 69]. Excessive generation of ROS levels leads to oxidative modification of biomolecules in postmitotic neurons that are associated with AD pathology [58, 70, 71]. Hence, we measured ROS levels using dihydroethidium (DHE) staining in eye-antennal imaginal discs when miR-277 levels were modulated in the background of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies. DHE is oxidized by superoxide radical to form 2-hydroxyethidium, which intercalates with DNA and provides signal at 550\\u2009nm in cells where ROS is produced [58, 72, 73]. The ROS puncta were calculated (within the yellow dotted line that marks ROI) from five imaginal discs per genotype and were used for statistical analysis (Fig. 5A\\u2013F). Misexpression of A\\u03b242 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242; Fig. 5B, F) results in prominent ROS production as compared to minimal ROS levels in wild-type control Canton-S (Fig. 5A, F).

Hence, high levels of miR-277 can downregulate ROS levels in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies.Fig. 5Modulation of miR-277 in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies reduces ROS production.Dihydroethidium (DHE) is employed to detect ROS production in cells.

The orientation of all imaginal discs is identical with posterior to the left and dorsal up. Scale bar\\u2009=\\u2009100\\u2009\\u03bcm. Since overexpression of miR-277 rescues the neurodegeneration phenotype of flies expressing A\\u03b242, we wanted to check if miR-277 can rescue the defects in eclosion rate observed in AD flies. To address this, we overexpressed miR-277 in the central nervous system by using Elav>Gal4 driver [42]. All wild-type flies that serve as control did not show any lethality and had 100% eclosion rate (Fig. 6A, n\\u2009=\\u2009270, 100%). Conversely, a high mortality rate was observed in Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 as only 37% (n\\u2009=\\u2009270) of the flies could hatch out and survive whereas the remaining 63% population failed to eclose as adults. However, overexpression of miR-277 resulted in significant improvement in the eclosion rate of Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies (Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+ miR-277; Fig. 6A, n\\u2009=\\u2009270) as 86.6% of flies hatched. Whereas when miR-277 was downregulated using miR-277 mutant (Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+ miR-277 mutant) or Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277KO deficiency (Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277KO), the eclosion rates reduced to 35.3% and 30% respectively (Fig. 6A, n\\u2009=\\u2009270). Thus, there is a significant improvement in eclosion rates when miR-277 is overexpressed in Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background.Fig. 6Overexpression of miR-277 reduces the mortality rate and rescues the climbing defects in AD flies.A The bar graph represents the number of flies eclosed. We compared the number of flies eclosed in 1. Elav Gal4, 2. Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242, 3. Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+ miR-277 and 4. Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+ miR-277 mutant 5.

We counted 270 flies in three independent biological sets from each background and plotted it on a graph in GraphPad Prism.

B Improved climbing activity when miR-277 is overexpressed in AD flies. We compared the number of flies which crossed 10\\u2009cm from the bottom of the vial. Graph represents the climbing activity of the flies from day 1\\u2013day 30. We assessed the locomotor function of AD flies in the miR-277 gain-of-function background using the climbing assay. Since we observed lethality with Elav\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies, we used OK107 Gal4 to drive human A\\u03b242 misexpression in the mushroom body neurons and their axons [51, 74\\u201376]. Previous studies have shown that OK107 Gal4 can be used to assess the locomotion [74\\u201376]. First, we overexpressed A\\u03b242 in mushroom body of larvae and adult using OK-Gal4 driver line and assayed the locomotor dysfunction in AD flies [40, 41]. We then compared the locomotor dysfunction of OK\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies with the ones where the levels of miR-277 expression were modulated in OK\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background. We checked their climbing ability from day 1 to day 30 of their eclosion as AD is an age-dependent disorder. The flies were cultured from the embryonic stage to adult stage on regular food. We performed climbing assay of one-day-old to one-month-old flies. We found climbing defects in OK\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies on day 1 and further worsened through day 30 as compared to OK-Gal4 (Fig. 6B). Overexpression of miR-277 in OK\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 (OK\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+ miR-277) flies exhibit significant rescue in climbing ability as compared to the control OK\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies (Fig. 6B). The climbing activity of OK\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+ miR-277 slightly decreased from day 20 to day 30 due to aging (Fig. 6B). Conversely, downregulation of miR-277 in OK\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 using miR-277 mutant (OK\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+ miR-277 mutant) or Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277KO (OK\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242\\u2009+\\u2009Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277KO) flies showed severe climbing defects as compared to OK\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 control flies which progressively worsened with the age (Fig. 6B). This data further demonstrates that miR-277 overexpression can restore the climbing defects of the OK\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies. To discern the molecular mechanism underlying miR-277-mediated rescue of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 neurodegenerative phenotype, we used bioinformatics tools like TargetScanFly and BLAST to predict targets of miR-277. It is known that miRNAs carry out their function by targeting the 3\\u2032UTR of their target mRNAs and thereby regulate gene expression. TargetScanFly predicts the targets of fly miRNA by matching the seed sequence (consensus sequence) of 3\\u2019untranslated region of the miRNA and their target mRNA [77] (http://www.targetscan.org/fly_72/). TargetScanFly predicted the proapoptotic factor- head involution defective (hid) as one of the mRNA targets with 0.24 PCT (Probability of conserved targeting) score and eight complementary consensus nucleotides (Supplementary Figure 3). Other software tools like DIANA and PicTar also predicted hid as one of the targets of miR-277 with the scores of 0.998 and 18, respectively. Additionally, BLAST tool predicted three different unique consensus sequences that were complementary between miR-277 and hid. Hence, we employed a genetic approach in order to validate whether hid and/or other proapoptotic factors is/are the target(s) of miR-277. Gain-of-function of hid, rpr, and grim in the developing eye by using GMR-Gal4 driver results in a strong phenotype of the highly reduced eye (Fig. 7A\\u2013C, G\\u2013I). We investigated if gain-of-function of miR-277 can rescue the reduced eye phenotype of GMR>hid, GMR>rpr, and GMR>grim. Surprisingly, gain-of-function of miR-277 in the GMR>hid+miR-277 background exhibit significant phenotypic rescue with frequency (n\\u2009=\\u2009600, 246/600\\u2009=\\u200941%) respectively (Fig. 7D, G, H, I). However, gain-of-function of miR-277 in GMR>rpr+miR-277 (Fig. 7E, G, H, I) and GMR>grim+miR-277 (Fig. 7F\\u2013I) did not show any rescue. This result ruled out the possibility that the other proapoptotic factors: rpr and grim being the targets of miR-277. Hence, gain-of-function of miR-277 in the GMR>hid flies significantly suppressed the eye degenerative phenotype (Fig. 7H) and increased the surface area of the eye (Fig. 7I), further validating our finding that hid is the target of miR-277.Fig. 7Gain-of-function of miR-277 rescues the hid-mediated cell death.A\\nGMR>hid,\\nB\\nGMR>rpr, and C\\nGMR>grim show reduced eye phenotype due to caspase-mediated cell death. D\\nGMR>hid+ miR-277 results in significant rescue as compared to GMR>hid flies.

G Bar graph shows frequency as average between three repetitions. Two hundred flies were counted per repetition (200\\u2009\\u00d7\\u20093\\u2009=\\u2009600) to calculate the frequency for each genotype (1. Canton-S, 2. GMR-Gal4, 3. GMR>hid, 4. GMR>hid+ miR-277, 5.

GMR>rpr 6. GMR>rpr+ miR-277, 7. GMR>grim, 8. GMR>grim+ miR-277). Statistical analysis was performed using the student\\u2019s t test for independent samples. H Quantitative analyses of severity score of neurodegenerative phenotypes(s) in eye. Flies from each genotype were randomly selected for scoring according to criteria described in the methods section. Comparisons were made using non-parametric: Mann\\u2013Whitney t test. I Quantitative analyses of area of the eye. The surface area of the eye (within white dotted line) was calculated using Image J. Statistical analysis was performed using the student\\u2019s t-test for independent samples. The surface area of GMR>hid+ miR-277 is significantly rescued (n\\u2009=\\u20095; p\\u2009=\\u20090.0000000073) as compared to GMR>hid. Error bars show standard error of mean (mean\\u2009\\u00b1\\u2009SEM). The orientation of all imaginal discs is identical with posterior to the left and dorsal up. Scale bar\\u2009=\\u2009100\\u2009\\u03bcm. Additionally, we also tested ROS by DHE staining in GMR>hid and observed high levels of ROS puncta (Supplementary Figure 4A). Interestingly, number of ROS puncta significantly reduced when miR-277 was misexpressed (GMR>hid+miR-277; Supplementary Figure 4B) as compared to the GMR>hid alone (Supplementary Figure 4A). The loss-of-function of miR-277 in GMR>hid background either by using miR-277 mutant (GMR>hid +miR-277 mutant; Supplementary Figure 4C) or Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277KO (GMR>hid\\u2009+\\u2009Df(3\\u2009R)miR-277KO; Supplementary Figure 4D) show significantly increased number of ROS puncta. This suggests that miR-277 downregulate ROS production in GMR>hid background. We also explored if other caspases like drice or Dark get regulated by miR-277. We examined the relative luciferase activity of drice, Dark, and hid by luciferase assay in S2 cells. The positive miRNA control used was miR-1, which was tagged to different pTub-ffLuc-3\\u2032UTR constructs. The value of relative luciferase activities of different pTub-ffLuc-3\\u2032UTR constructs with miR-277 was calculated from the normalization of the luciferase activities of control: miR-1. If any of the caspases are the target of miR-277, it will bind to the 3\\u2032UTR of its target mRNA, degrades the target mRNA, and hence will exhibit less luciferase activity. The relative luciferase activity of hid with miR-277 was significantly reduced by 50% as compared to the positive control (Fig. 8A). The relative luciferase activity of dark with miR-277 was significantly reduced by 25% as compared to the positive control (Fig. 8A). Whereas the relative luciferase activity of drice with miR-277 was slightly increased as compared to the positive control (Fig. 8A). Hence, luciferase activity suggested that hid is the target of miR-277 and not the other caspases.Fig. 8hid is the target of miR-277.A In vitro dual-luciferase reporter assays of miR-mRNA interactions in S2 cell. The mean\\u2009\\u00b1\\u2009SEM of the relative luciferase expression ratio (firefly luciferase/Renilla luciferase, Luc/R-luc) was calculated for four biological replicates and compared with the control miRNA, miR-1. Statistical analysis was performed using student\\u2019s t test for independent samples. The results of dual-luciferase reporter assays of target 3\\u2032UTR of drice, hid, and Dark have showed that miR-277 can efficiently target hid and Dark except for drice. B Relative expression of hid at the transcriptional level using quantitative PCR (qPCR) in genotypes (1. GMR-Gal4 2. GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242, 3. GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+ miR-277, 4.

The hid transcript levels were significantly increased by ~1.75-fold in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 eye imaginal discs as compared to the control GMR-Gal4 eye imaginal discs (Fig. 8B). hid mRNA levels were significantly downregulated by ~2.3-fold in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+ miR-277 eye imaginal discs as compared to the GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 alone (Fig. 8B).

Hence, our results strongly suggest that miR-277 ameliorates A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration by post-transcriptionally regulating hid expression in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies. To validate if hid is the target of miR-277, we employed hid5\\u2019F-WT-GFP reporter, which was generated to characterize the role of E2F binding site (present in 5\\u2032 ends of hid) in hid transcription [43]. A 2.2Kb fragment containing the hid 5\\u2032 E2F binding site was cloned into the pH-stinger GFP vector to generate hid5\\u2019F-WT GFP transgenic line [43, 78]. The hid GFP intensity within the yellow dotted line was calculated from five imaginal discs of each genotype and was used for statistical analysis (Fig. 8C\\u2013H). Minimal levels of GFP reporter expression were observed in wild-type hid5\\u2019F-WT eye-antennal imaginal discs (Fig. 8C, D) [43]. In comparison to the hid5\\u2019F-WT GFP control (Fig. 8C, D), ~2.5-fold high levels of hid-GFP were observed in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 eye discs (Fig. 8C, E).

Hence, overexpression of miR-277 in the background of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242+ miR-277), targets 3\\u2032UTR of hid mRNA, silences its expression, and hence rescues the reduced eye phenotype seen in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies (Fig. 9).Fig. 9miR-277 ameliorates the neurodegenerative phenotype of GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 fly eye.Misexpression of A\\u03b242 (GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 flies) results in the accumulation of amyloid plaques and causes aberrant activation of caspase Hid resulting in neurodegenerative adult eye phenotype.

AD, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is caused by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tau tangles (NFTs). As per the Amyloid cascade hypothesis, the formation and accumulation of amyloid plaques and NFTs initiate other biochemical changes like oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction due to aberrant signaling that eventually leads to neuronal cell death [79\\u201381]. However, the mechanism(s) underlying AD-mediated neurodegeneration is not been fully understood [26, 82]. To understand the pathophysiology of AD, many animal models have been generated, including Drosophila melanogaster, which has proven very valuable due to the genetic conservation, ease of handling, and the large genetic repository and experimental tools [12, 13, 25]. Human A\\u03b242 is ectopically misexpressed in differentiating retinal neurons of fly and mimics AD-like neuropathology [17]. Drosophila AD models allow us to explore and test the signaling pathways involved in AD by genetic approaches. Numerous signaling pathways like the JNK pathway, Hippo pathway, caspases, GSK pathway etc. are aberrantly activated or dysregulated in AD [17, 83, 84]. Besides, members of these pathways involved in AD also cross-talk with each other making the disease even more complicated. In eukaryotic systems, microRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved and are considered as essential components of gene regulatory networks. miRNAs play crucial roles in the regulation of gene expression and are implicated in various biological processes, including development, metabolism, and disease. miRNAs significantly affect signaling pathways and cause alterations of cellular signaling that can impact human diseases [85, 86]. We identified a highly conserved miR-277, as one of the genetic modifiers, which can rescue the A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration using Drosophila eye model. miR-277 expression is enriched in larval brain, gut, fat body, and adult head, brain, eyes, gut, fat body (https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0262419.html). The mechanism(s) underlying the effects of miR-277 targets involved in AD is still unknown. In AD, synaptic dysfunction occurs due to neuronal cell death and impaired axonal targeting [87, 88]. Using the Drosophila eye model, we found that gain-of-function of miR-277 restores the axonal targeting defects observed in AD [16, 17]. Additionally, miR-277-mediated rescue is not restricted to morphological rescue only but it also promotes functional rescue as evidenced from behavioral assays like the eclosion rate and rescue of climbing defects. The Drosophila AD model shows robust cell death that is rescued by the gain-of-function of miR-277. Moreover, AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease where the neurodegenerative phenotype progressively worsens with time, such as in pupal retina, photoreceptors are fused due to excessive cell death. However overexpression of miR-277 restores the hexagonal structure of ommatidia and a number of pigment cells by inhibiting the apoptosis present in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 pupal retina. Recently, the anti-apoptotic function of miR-277 has been reported where gain-of-function of miR-277 rescues the tumor suppressor gene, lethal giant larvae (lgl), mutant clones in third instar larvae, which would otherwise be eliminated due to cell death [89], and miR-277 is also expressed in hub cells and may contribute to their protection [90, 91]. Furthermore, to discern the molecular genetic mechanism(s) for miR-277 neuroprotective function, we screened for its target mRNA and identified hid, a proapoptotic gene, as one of its targets. Earlier, we have shown that aberrant activation of evolutionarily conserved JNK signaling pathway induces hid expression, which triggers cell death response seen in A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration [17]. In GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 background there is a significant decrease in hid transcript levels, as evident from hid-GFP reporter studies and qPCR assays. However, gain-of-function of miR-277 in GMR\\u2009>\\u2009A\\u03b242 significantly reduces the hid transcript levels. Based on our results from hid transcript level studies as well as luciferase reporter assay, we propose a model where miR-277 binds to 3\\u2032UTR of hid and degrades the expression of hid transcript (Fig. 9). Hence, we show here for the first time that miR-277 achieves its neuroprotective function by downregulating hid transcript levels thereby ameliorating A\\u03b242-mediated neurodegeneration. miR-277 has also been implicated in neurodegenerative disease like Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) [92]. However, its role in other neurodegenerative disorders like ALS, Parkinson\\u2019s, Huntington, etc is not yet determined. Further studies on the regulatory network and downstream targets of miR-277 will deepen our understanding of its biological significance and potential implications in human health and other neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, microRNAs (miRNAs), which serve as invaluable tool for manipulating target gene expression [93, 94], have gained attention as potential biomarkers in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders like AD [95]. MiRNAs, carried by exosomes and microparticles in the blood and exhibiting greater stability than mRNAs, are valuable diagnostic biomarkers to enhance the accuracy of AD diagnoses [35, 96]. Insights into the roles of miRNAs in AD, particularly through affecting the signaling pathways, can make miRNAs attractive tools for novel therapeutic approaches. Mutations affecting three proapoptotic genes: hid, rpr and grim, nearly completely eliminate the process of apoptosis during development [97]. However, research suggests that the overexpression of hid leads to cell death in various tissues of transgenic animals, as well as in cultured insect and mammalian cells [98]. Previous study demonstrates that role of hid as an inducer of cell death in Drosophila is conserved in mammalian cells, suggesting the possible existence of a mammalian homolog of this crucial apoptosis regulator [97]. When co-transfected with certain inhibitors, apoptosis is significantly reduced, indicating that Bcl2-type anti-apoptotic genes can inhibit Hid-induced apoptosis in mammalian cells. The inhibition of Hid\\u2019s proapoptotic activity by DIAP1 in mammalian cells mirrors a similar regulatory process as in insect cells, and the involvement of a mammalian IAP, XIAP, further indicates the evolutionary conservation of IAP-mediated inhibition of Hid activity [97]. Drosophila RHG proteins are functional counterparts to the mammalian Smac/DIABLO proteins, and they work by binding to and reducing the levels of IAP [99, 100]. Hence, the presence of an apoptosis pathway activated by hid in mammalian cells, regulated by conserved molecular components, strongly suggests the existence of a vertebrate hid counterpart. Based on the conserved seed sequence, the human ortholog of miR-277 is hsa-miR-3660 (https://www.mirbase.org/). hsa-miR-3660 is expressed in the nervous system (brain and cortex) and reproductive system (testis and uterus) as shown in RNA seq data (https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=MIR3660). It has been shown by GWAS studies that hsa-miR-3660 is implicated in human diseases such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [101], rheumatic heart disease [102], and lung cancer [103\\u2013105]. Moreover, it has been shown that hsa-miR-3660 is dysregulated in pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEXG) [106]. However, its role in Alzheimer\\u2019s Disease has not been shown to date. A multiple sequence alignment analysis has identified a putative binding site for hsa-miR-3660 within the 3\\u2032 untranslated region (3\\u2032UTR) of the gene hid. It is possible that hsa-miR-3660 could bind to the mammalian component of hid and degrade it. One of the potential targets predicted of hsa-miR-3660 is associated with the CARD domain (https://www.targetscan.org/vert_80/). The CARD domain, which stands for Caspase Activation and Recruitment Domain, is a protein module involved in initiating and regulating various signaling pathways, particularly those related to apoptosis (programmed cell death) and inflammation [107, 108]. The CARD domain in caspase 2 and caspase 9, initiator caspases, facilitate the formation of protein complexes involved in the apoptotic signaling cascade [107, 108]. In AD, the dysregulation of caspase 2 and caspase 9 activation may contribute to the loss-of neurons and the progression of the disease [107]. Hence, the identification of specific targets regulated by hsa-miR-3660 holds significant promise for advancing therapeutic strategies for AD. Further exploration of hsa-miR-3660 in AD mammalian model systems and AD patient\\u2019s brain samples and biofluids can help shed light on the etiology of AD or potential role of hsa-miR-3660 (an ortholog of fly miR-277) as a biomarker and as a druggable target of AD. In the future, hsa-miR-3660 inhibitor, can be employed to specifically bind to and inhibit the activity of endogenous hsa-miR-3660.

Pathologically, the AD brain is characterized by extracellular plaques composed of fibrillary A\\u03b2 surrounded by activated astrocytes, microglia, and dystrophic neurites. Other pathological hallmarks are accumulation of A\\u03b2 in the vasculature, neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, brain atrophy, and loss of neurons and synapses (1). The accumulation of A\\u03b2 in AD brain starts several years to decades before clinical symptoms appear (2) and research during the past decades suggest that soluble forms of A\\u03b2 rather than A\\u03b2 plaques are neurotoxic and correlate with cognitive decline in AD (3). Different mechanisms behind A\\u03b2 toxicity have been suggested. Several studies have shown that oligomeric forms of A\\u03b2 can bind to cell surface receptors at neuronal synapses (4, 5), whereas other studies suggest that intracellular A\\u03b242 is neurotoxic. Analyses of intraneuronal A\\u03b2 levels in neurons dissected by laser capture microscopy from postmortem control and AD brain showed that pyramidal neurons in cornu ammonis 1 of AD hippocampus display increased A\\u03b242 levels and increased A\\u03b242/A\\u03b240 ratio in sporadic and familial AD cases (6). The study suggested that there is a correlation between high intracellular A\\u03b242 levels and vulnerability to AD neuropathology. An electron microscopy study showed that the intracellular accumulation of A\\u03b242 in human AD brain and a transgenic AD mouse model (Tg2576) occurs predominantly within neuronal processes and an accumulation in synaptic compartments was observed (7). The neurotoxicity of intracellular A\\u03b2 is also supported by a study in which autophagy-deficient mice were cross-bred with amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice (8). Intriguingly, the cross-bred mice show impaired secretion of A\\u03b2, resulting in highly increased intracellular levels of A\\u03b2. This increase was accompanied by severe memory impairment, significantly worse compared with the APP transgenic mice (8). An increasing amount of studies suggest that A\\u03b2 is of importance in normal synaptic function, such as developmental synaptic plasticity (9). Thus, it is important to study the synthesis, localization, and function of A\\u03b2 both from a physiological and pathological perspective. A\\u03b2 is formed from the APP by the sequential action of two transmembrane aspartyl proteases. BACE-1 first cleaves APP to generate a 99-residue C-terminal fragment (C99), which is subsequently cleaved by the protein complex \\u03b3-secretase, generating an APP intracellular domain (AICD) and A\\u03b2 of variable lengths (10, 11). The most common form contains 40 amino acids (A\\u03b240), whereas the longer forms (A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b243) are more aggregation-prone and neurotoxic (12, 13). Several studies have shown that APP can be transported along axons and dendrites to nerve terminals (14, 15, 16). Moreover, BACE1 and \\u03b3-secretase have been found to be enriched at the neuronal synapse and it has been suggested that A\\u03b2 is indeed produced at the synapse (17, 18). Whether or not neuronal A\\u03b2 is secreted in an activity-dependent manner has been debated, and a recent study suggested that the release of A\\u03b2 is mostly constituent and not significantly correlated to the activity-dependent release of glutamate (19). However, neither the physiological importance nor the mechanism by which this occurs has been clarified. Here, we asked the following questions: Is A\\u03b242 found all over neurites or enriched at the synapse? Is it found on the pre- or postsynaptic side or both? Which intracellular structures/organelles is it associated with? Confocal microscopy with a best possible resolution of around 200 nm is not sufficient to resolve most synaptic structures. For instance, synaptic vesicles are 40\\u201350 nm in diameter and the synaptic cleft is only 20\\u201325 nm wide. Therefore, we used super-resolution microscopy to study the localization of endogenously derived A\\u03b242 in the neurites of primary hippocampal neurons. Intriguingly, we were able to resolve different types of fine structures of intracellular A\\u03b242 that cannot be resolved by confocal microscopy, revealing novel information about the synaptic localization of A\\u03b242 that may be crucial for understanding its physiological function and the mechanism behind its neurotoxicity. This study was performed to determine the precise localization of endogenous A\\u03b242 in neurites and synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons by super-resolution microscopy. It has previously been shown that intraneuronal levels of A\\u03b242 correlate with neuropathology in AD (20, 21). There is also a correlation between synaptic degeneration and development of AD, and A\\u03b242 has been shown to be synaptotoxic (4, 16, 22, 23). Because the synaptic cleft is only 20\\u201325 nm wide (24) and the best possible resolution obtained by confocal microscopy is around 200 nm, super-resolution microscopy is required to determine the synaptic localization of macromolecules with sufficient resolution and precision. A recent study using super-resolution microscopy to investigate the localization of the A\\u03b2-producing protease \\u03b3-secretase in the neurites showed that this enzyme is enriched at the synapse and that it is present at both the pre- and the postsynaptic side (18). Because \\u03b3-secretase can process around 100 substrates besides APP, it is important to determine at which subcellular localizations it can perform its various activities. Here, we studied the localization of A\\u03b242 in the neurites by using an A\\u03b242-specific antibody. This antibody has been thoroughly characterized previously (25, 26). It was further validated here by Western blotting (WB) (Fig S1), supporting the notion that this A\\u03b242-specific antibody targets the free C-terminus of A\\u03b242 and has no cross-reactivity with A\\u03b240 or full-length APP. The presynaptic marker synaptophysin and the postsynaptic marker PSD95 were visualized by antibodies previously shown to be suitable for stimulated emission depletion (STED) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) imaging of hippocampal neurons (18). The structure of the neurites was visualized using phalloidin, which binds to filamentous actin. STED experiments were set up with two STED channels, one for A\\u03b242 and one for either of the two synaptic markers (synaptophysin or PSD95). The same depletion doughnut was used in both STED channels to ensure perfect colocalization between these two channels. The actin pattern was imaged in a third, confocal channel throughout this study. The synaptic localization of A\\u03b242 was further confirmed by two-color dSTORM experiments. WB of purified A\\u03b242 and mouse brain homogenate samples were incubated with the A\\u03b242-specific antibody (anti-A\\u03b2C42, red) and an antibody recognizing the A\\u03b2 sequence within APP (4G8, green). The merged channel is shown to the left, and the individual channels are shown in the middle and to the right. The molecular weight is shown by an Odyssey Protein Molecular Weight Marker (LI-COR) on the right hand side and low-range Amersham Rainbow Marker (RPN 755E; GE Healthcare) on the left hand side. The fluorescence labeling of A\\u03b242, synaptic markers, and filamentous actin was first optimized and analyzed by confocal microscopy. The culturing of mouse primary hippocampal neurons for 21 d in vitro results in an elaborate network of axons and dendrites with well-developed specialized synaptic contacts, including dense PSD clusters in the spine heads and enrichment of synaptophysin-containing synaptic vesicles on the opposing, presynaptic side (18, 27). The specificity of the fluorescence labeling was analyzed by using negative controls, lacking one of the primary antibodies, to confirm that there was no cross-talk between the channels and that the secondary antibodies did not cross-react (Fig S2). In agreement with previous studies, A\\u03b242 staining was present in the perinuclear region and in the neurites (27).

Scale bars: 5 \\u03bcm. Confocal images of the network of the neurites in samples stained for A\\u03b242, synaptophysin, and filamentous actin showed an accumulation of A\\u03b242 at the synapse, but it was not possible to distinguish whether A\\u03b242 was localized to the pre- or postsynapses (Fig 1A). Imaging the same regions using STED microscopy we were able resolve the fine structures in the neurites (Fig 1B). Close-ups of the STED images (Fig 1B, middle and right panels) demonstrated that synaptophysin and A\\u03b242 are interspersed within the same regions in the neurites, suggesting that A\\u03b242 is present at the presynapse. Because our previous study showed that axonal \\u03b3-secretase is enriched in the presynapse (18), we propose that this pool of intracellular endogenous A\\u03b242 is synthesized in the presynaptic region. (A, B) Hippocampal neurons stained to visualize A\\u03b242 (red), synaptophysin (green), and actin (light grey) were imaged by confocal microscopy (A) and STED microscopy (B).

Left scale bars: 4 \\u03bcm. Other scale bars: 1 \\u03bcm. A comparison between confocal and STED microscopy was also performed for samples stained for the postsynaptic marker PSD95, A\\u03b242, and filamentous actin (Fig 1C and D). Confocal microscopy showed that A\\u03b242 clusters were located close to PSD95-containing spine heads (Fig 1C). With STED microscopy we were able to reveal that such clusters contain small vesicles adjacent to, but not colocalizing with, the postsynaptic spine heads (Fig 1D), in line with a presynaptic localization. At a nonsynaptic part of a neurite, we noted a different type of A\\u03b242 structure, which only contained A\\u03b242 on the rim and was much larger than the vesicles found at the synapse (Fig 1D and see below for more details). Notably, these different A\\u03b242-containing structures, small vesicles at the synapse and larger nonsynaptic bodies, could only be resolved and differentiated by using STED. Our findings thus demonstrate that super-resolution microscopy is required both to determine the synaptic localization of A\\u03b242 and to distinguish between different types of A\\u03b242 structures in the neuronal compartments. Although the actin staining is present both in dendrites and in most of the axons, the staining in dendrites is considerably denser, particularly at the spine heads, whereas the axonal staining is weaker (18). However, by adapting contrast settings in the images, it is possible to optimize visualization either of the densely stained dendrites (Fig 2A and B, left panels) or, with increased brightness, the axons (Fig 2A and B, right panels). As in previous studies, the dendrites have extensive axonal networks along with as well as between them (18). (A) STED image showing A\\u03b242 (red) and synaptophysin (green) combined with a confocal channel for actin (light grey). The left image has a lower brightness in the actin channel than the right image. Note that the axonal staining appears for many axons only in the right image with increased brightness. This image was further zoomed-in in Fig 3A to focus on the synapses. Scale bars: 2 \\u03bcm. (B) STED image showing A\\u03b242 (red) and PSD95 (cyan) combined with a confocal channel for actin (light grey). The left image has a lower brightness in the actin channel than in the right channel. Note the intensive axon network both between and along the neurites. Scale bars: 2 \\u03bcm. Analyzing a large number of synapses from different areas of the dish, we found that most of the A\\u03b242 staining in the neurites was present within the same region as the synaptophysin clusters. Interestingly, both A\\u03b242 and synaptophysin appeared to be present in vesicular structures of similar size, and to some extent colocalized (Figs 3A and B, and S3A and B). The appearance of the synaptophysin staining is in agreement with previous electron microscopy studies showing that synaptic vesicles are uniform in size with a diameter of around 40\\u201350 nm (28). It is highly intriguing that we now observed that some vesicles of similar size as synaptic vesicles stained for A\\u03b242 but not synaptophysin. Because colocalization of A\\u03b242 and synaptophysin was observed in some areas, it is unlikely that the absence of synaptophysin staining in these vesicles is due to steric hindrance of the antibody but rather indicates the presence of A\\u03b242-containing vesicles that lack synaptophysin. To further test this hypothesis, we compared the samples stained for A\\u03b242 and synaptophysin with samples stained for synaptophysin and another synaptic vesicle protein\\u2014synaptobrevin. In the presynaptic regions of the A\\u03b242/synaptophysin samples, 19% of the stained pixels were positive for only A\\u03b242, 36% were positive for both A\\u03b242 and synaptophysin, and 45% were positive for only synaptophysin (Fig S4). Thus, 35% of the A\\u03b242-stained pixels did not colocalize with synaptophysin and 56% of the synaptophysin-stained pixels did not colocalize with A\\u03b242 (Fig S4). Doing the same operation for the synaptobrevin/synaptophysin samples, we found that 15% of the stained pixels were positive for only synaptobrevin, 52% were positive for both synaptobrevin and synaptophysin, and 33% were positive for only synaptophysin. Thus, only 22% of the synaptobrevin-positive pixels did not colocalize with synaptophysin, and 39% of the synaptophysin-positive pixels did not colocalize with synaptobrevin. The synaptobrevin/synaptophysin colocalization was somewhat lower than we expected, possibly because of labeling efficacies lower than 100%. Another potential explanation is that the size of the primary\\u2013secondary antibody complex may provide a detection area somewhat larger than the actual vesicle size. Alternatively, the vesicle pool could be more heterogeneous than expected. Still, the lower extent of colocalization of A\\u03b242/synaptophysin compared with synaptobrevin/synaptophysin in the presynaptic region supports our notion that part of the A\\u03b242-containing vesicles may be distinct from the synaptic vesicles responsible for neurotransmitter release. Previous work has shown that A\\u03b242 release can occur independently of glutamate release (19), supporting our notion that a fraction of A\\u03b242 is present in vesicles that differ from the vesicles responsible for transmitter release. (A, B) Zoomed STED images of synapses showing A\\u03b242 (red) and the presynaptic marker synaptophysin (green). Neuronal structure is shown by actin in a confocal channel (light grey) merged to the STED channels in the left panel. The staining of synaptophysin and A\\u03b242 at presynaptic boutons connected to the postsynaptic spines are shown by the yellow arrows.

The staining of A\\u03b242 combined with the presynaptic marker synaptophysin (green bar) or postsynaptic marker PSD95 (cyan bar) was quantified from STED data. Graphpad prism was used to prepare graphs showing the proportion \\u00b1 SD of presynapses (n = 73) and postsynapses (n = 73) that were positively stained by A\\u03b242.

(C, D) Zoomed STED images of synapses showing A\\u03b242 (red) and the presynaptic marker PSD95 (cyan) combined with actin in a confocal channel (light grey) in the left panel.

Colocalization between A\\u03b242 or synaptobrevin with synaptophysin staining in presynapses. The percentage of presynaptic marker synaptophysin (green) staining combined with A\\u03b242 staining (red) or another presynaptic marker synaptobrevin (red) was quantified from STED data using imageJ based on the area of staining using Otsu thresholding. Meta-chart was used to prepare Venn charts. 50 regions of interest were quantified for each staining combination. Total stained pixels in each region of interest was set to 100%. The appearance of vesicles that contain A\\u03b242 and/or synaptophysin was observed both in immature presynapses that have not yet formed a contact with a dendritic spine (Fig 3A) and in presynapses that are in contact with dendritic spine heads (Fig 3B). Notably, our previous super-resolution microscopy study showed that the enzyme complex \\u03b3-secretase, which is required for the generation of A\\u03b242, is also present in both immature and mature synapses (18). Together, these findings imply that A\\u03b242 and/or \\u03b3-secretase have a role(s) in synaptic formation and maintenance. PSD95 imaging by STED beautifully outlined PSD clusters at the top of the spine heads and these clusters, in contrast to synaptophysin clusters, showed no or only little overlap with A\\u03b242 (Figs 3C and D, and S3C and D). A clear enrichment close to the PSD clusters was observed, on the other side of the synapse, again supporting the presynaptic localization of A\\u03b242. This presynaptic clustering of A\\u03b242 vesicles opposite to PSD clusters was obvious both for stubby spines (Fig 3C) and mushroom spines (Fig 3C and D). Quantification of individual synapses stained for A\\u03b242, phalloidin, and synaptophysin or PSD95 showed that the majority (97 \\u00b1 2.5%) of presynapses were positive for A\\u03b242 vesicles, whereas only very few of the postsynapses (5.2 \\u00b1 4.5%) were positive for A\\u03b242 staining (Fig 3E). The latter could be because of a small extent of false positive results if some of the dendritic spines were not perfectly aligned perpendicular to the optical axis, i.e., because of the lower resolution along the z-axis. The occurrence of larger A\\u03b242-containing structures (Fig 1D), with a diameter ranging between 200 and 600 nm (Fig S5) and enriched in A\\u03b242 in the outer portions, were further investigated. Although the staining was intense at the rim, A\\u03b242 is most likely enriched in the interior of the vesicle, close to the membrane. In contrast to the smaller vesicles, these vesicles were located on or close to neurites in regions lacking spine heads, synaptophysin, or PSD95 clusters (Fig 4A and B), indicating that they are not present at the synapse. Interestingly, a previous electron microscopy study showed that A\\u03b242 is enriched at the membrane of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) in neurons both in human AD brain and in brain from mice and rats, especially in pyramidal neurons from the cortex and hippocampus, which are most prone to develop AD neuropathology (7). Furthermore, it has also been shown that A\\u03b2 can be produced in a macroautophagy-dependent pathway involving autophagosomes and late autophagic vacuoles, which are multivesicular entities with a diameter of around 500 nm (29). Because intraneuronal A\\u03b242 can be directly derived by endogenous production or secreted and taken up by endocytosis of external A\\u03b242, it is possible that the sources of A\\u03b242 in MVBs and presynaptic vesicles are of different origin. STED images stained with A\\u03b242 (red) and PSD95 (cyan) combined with an actin (light grey) confocal channel. 15 vesicles in total were measured using Adobe Illustrator. Scale bar: 2 \\u03bcm. Zoomed STED images of A\\u03b242 (red), PSD95 (cyan), and actin (light grey) at nonsynaptic neuritic regions (A) and only the A\\u03b242 and PSD95 channel (B). Yellow arrows show A\\u03b242 vesicles which are hollow inside. The diameter from left to right is 520, 480, and 490 nm, respectively. Images were zoomed from Fig S3. Scale bars: 1 \\u03bcm. The size of synaptic structures and vesicles makes diffraction unlimited super-resolution microscopy indispensable for investigating synaptic localizations of proteins. All diffraction unlimited techniques rely on switching between two discernible states, and two classes of diffraction unlimited super-resolution techniques can be distinguished: spatially targeted methods such as STED and spatially stochastic techniques such as, for instance, photoactivated localization microscopy and STORM (30, 31). All these methods can overcome the diffraction barrier substantially. So, we asked if the synaptic localization of A\\u03b242 can also be seen using a spatially stochastic super-resolution technique. Here, we applied dSTORM (32, 33), using the two photo-switchable fluorophores, Alexa Fluor 647 and Atto 488, as reporters for A\\u03b242 and the synaptic marker, respectively. In agreement with the STED images, A\\u03b242 was dispersed within the same region as synaptophysin (Fig 5A) but not as PSD95 (Fig 5B), supporting our notion that A\\u03b242 is localized at the presynapse in pyramidal neurons. Importantly, there was no or very little direct overlap between A\\u03b242 and synaptophysin staining. These findings show that A\\u03b242 localization can be analyzed also by using spatially stochastic approaches and support our suggestion that A\\u03b242 is partially present in vesicles different from those containing synaptophysin. (A) dSTORM images show A\\u03b242 (red) and synaptophysin (green). Two different presynaptic regions from the same image are shown in the left and right image. Note that the A\\u03b242 staining appears as vesicles that are interspersed in the same region as synaptophysin. Scale bars: 500 nm. (B) STORM images show A\\u03b242 (red) and PSD95 (cyan). Two different postsynaptic regions from the same image are shown in the left and right image. Note the proximity between A\\u03b242 and PSD95, in agreement with a synaptic cleft between the two stains. The somewhat overlap in the left panel is probably related to the fact that the synapse is not in the plane of the image. Scale bars: 500 nm. The confocality of a STED microscope and the easy implementation of additional (confocal) reference channels make it particularly suitable also for analyzing complex structures such as neuronal cultures. To analyze pre- or postsynaptic protein localizations, the positioning of the synapse with respect to the optical axis of the microscope has to be considered. Conventional 2D STED using a vortex phase plate provides very high lateral resolution but the axial resolution is still unaltered confocal, which means that structures that are aligned along this axis cannot be resolved beyond the diffraction limit. Therefore, we focused in the previous part on synapses that are aligned perpendicular to the optical axis. To analyze the localization of A\\u03b242 in a 3D context, we used 3D STED, providing super-resolution in all directions. The presynaptic localization of A\\u03b242 could be confirmed using 3D STED. We found A\\u03b242 partially colocalizing with synaptophysin (Video 1), whereas the lack of overlap between the PSD95 and A\\u03b242 staining (Video 2) was apparent in all three dimensions, confirming our 2D STED observations. 3D rendering of confocal and 3D STED stacks of A\\u03b242, synaptophysin, and actin. The first part of the movie shows an animated rendering of confocal stacks of A\\u03b242, synaptophysin, and actin. Here, it is not possible to judge the degree of colocalization of A\\u03b242 and synaptophysin because of the limited resolution, especially along the optical (z-) axis. The second part of the movie shows the same region imaged with 3D STED in the A\\u03b242 and synaptophysin channel. These 3D super-resolution data show that the A\\u03b242 and synaptophysin signal is overlapping in some of the presynapses.Download video 3D rendering of confocal and 3D STED stacks of A\\u03b242, PSD95, and actin.The first part of the movie shows an animated rendering of confocal stacks of A\\u03b242, PSD95, and actin.

Interestingly, presynaptic A\\u03b242 was localized to vesicles of similar size as synaptic vesicles, some of which lacked synapthophysin, suggesting that a fraction of A\\u03b242 is present in a previously non-characterized vesicle in the presynapse. Intriguingly, these data may explain the controversy regarding the dependency of A\\u03b2 secretion on synaptic activity. Moreover, we could also resolve larger, nonsynaptic structures in which A\\u03b242 showed a donut-like appearance, in line with the presence of A\\u03b242 in the outer membrane of MVB. Thus, these findings provide crucial information on the subcellular details and the molecular mechanisms behind the role of A\\u03b242 in normal synaptic function and in AD pathogenesis. The C57BL6 mice used in this study for preparing hippocampal neurons and mouse brain homogenate were treated according to the Karolinska Institutet's and the national guidelines. Embryonic mice brains (E16.5) were used for the dissection of hippocampi. The brains of the female mice carrying the embryos were used for WB. After dissection, these brains were homogenized in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM EGTA, and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), at pH 7.5. No experiments were performed on live animals. The study was approved by the animal research ethical committee in southern Stockholm. Animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Mouse hippocampal neurons were cultured in 35-mm glass bottom culture dishes (P35-G-1.5-10-C; MatTek) with 2% B27 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% l-glutamine (Gibco) in Neurobasal medium (Gibco), essentially as described previously (34, 35). Briefly, the dishes were coated with poly-d-lysine (P7405; Sigma) at least 1 d before the dissection. Hippocampi and cortices were dissected and single cells were triturated by repeated pipetting of the tissue in cell medium. 7,500 hippocampal cells (with 125 \\u03bcl medium) were seeded on glass in the middle of the plate, and 150,000 cortical cells (with 500 \\u03bcl medium) were seeded as support cells on the surrounding plastic (to avoid direct contact between the cell types). The cells were kept in the incubator (37\\u00b0C, 5% CO2) for 2 h and then 2.5 ml fresh medium was added. After 21 d, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (252549; Sigma) for 10 min at RT and stored in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (Gibco) at 4\\u00b0C for immunocytochemistry staining. A rabbit antibody specific for the C-terminal neo-epitope of A\\u03b242 (anti-A\\u03b2C42) was used for immunofluorescence labeling of A\\u03b242 throughout these studies. This affinity-purified antibody, targeting the six C-terminal residues of A\\u03b242, has previously been shown not to cross-react with either A\\u03b240 or full-length APP (25). To further validate the antibody, WB blotting was performed and compared with mouse antibody 4G8 (BioLegend), which is reactive to amino acid residues 17\\u201324 of the A\\u03b2 sequence within APP. IRDye 800CW (LI-COR) and IRDye 680RD secondary antibodies (LI-COR) were used for WB. Mouse anti-PSD95 IgG, here denoted anti-PSD95 (Ab2723; Abcam), was used as a postsynaptic marker whereas mouse anti-synaptophysin IgG, here denoted anti-synaptophysin (SP15; Enzo Life Sciences), was used as a presynaptic marker. Mouse anti-synaptobrevin IgG, here denoted anti-synaptobrevin (104203; Synaptic Systems), was used as another presynaptic marker. All of these antibodies have previously been shown to be suitable for confocal, STED, and STORM experiments (18). The Atto 488\\u2013labeled secondary antibody used for dSTORM was prepared by the conjugation of NHS-Atto 488 (ATTO-TEC) to donkey anti-mouse IgG (A16019; Life Technologies). Labeling was performed essentially as described previously (18) by incubating Atto 488-NHS (0.02 mg/tube) dissolved in 10 \\u03bcl anhydrous DMSO, with 50 \\u03bcl donkey anti-mouse IgG (1.25 mg/ml in PBS), 6 \\u03bcl of 1 M NaHCO3, and 1.5 \\u03bcl Atto 488-NHS for for 30 min at RT, followed by purification using size exclusion chromatography on NAP-5 columns (GE Healthcare). Fluorescently labeled commercial secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit IgG Fab Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen), anti-rabbit IgG Abberrior STAR 635P, and anti-mouse IgG Alexa Flour 594 (Invitrogen). The neuronal structure was visualized by staining the actin cytoskeleton with Alexa Flour 488\\u2013phalloidin (Invitrogen). The imaging buffer for STORM experiments containing 0.124 M cysteamine (Sigma), 44.8 mM HCl, 8.6% glucose, 1.08 mg/ml glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger (Sigma), and 0.0773 mg/ml catalase from bovine liver (Sigma) in PBS was mixed directly before imaging and used for no longer than 1 h. Fresh stock solutions (1 M cysteamine in 360 mM HCl, 10% Glucose in PBS, 70 mg/ml glucose oxidase in PBS, and 20 mg/ml catalase in PBS) were prepared the day before imaging and stored at 4\\u00b0C. Purified recombinant human A\\u03b242 and mouse brain homogenate samples were diluted with LI-COR sample loading buffer and separated on 4%\\u201312% Bis\\u2013Tris gel (Invitrogen) in MES SDS running buffer (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). Membranes were blocked by Odyssey blocking buffer (927-50000; LI-COR) for 1 h at RT, followed by incubation with A\\u03b242-specific antibody and 4G8 primary antibody overnight. The membranes were washed with 0.1% Tween-TBS for 3 \\u00d7 5 min, incubated with anti-mouse and anti-rabbit LI-COR secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT, washed again, and followed by imaging in the Odyssey imaging system. The system can detect two protein targets that have been incubated with two different secondary antibodies labeled with spectrally distinct near-infrared fluorophores. The results can be shown as a merge image and as separate 700- and 800-nm channel images in pseudo-color or grayscale. Fixed cells were permeabilized in 0.4% CHAPSO (Merck Millipore) in DPBS for 10 min at RT and blocked with 10% normal goat serum (NGS; Invitrogen) for 15 min at RT. Dishes were subsequently incubated with the primary antibodies in 3%\\u20135% NGS in DPBS overnight at 4\\u00b0C. For the preparation of samples for STED imaging, anti-A\\u03b242 (1:100) was used in combination with either anti-PSD95 diluted 1:200 or mouse anti-synaptophysin diluted 1:200 followed by washing with PBS 3 \\u00d7 5 min. For colocalization studies, anti-synaptophysin (1:200) was also used in combination with anti-synaptobrevin (1:200). Incubation with the secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit Abberior Star 635P (1:200), anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 (1:200), and Alexa Fluor 488\\u2013phalloidin (1:100), was subsequently performed for 2\\u20133 h, followed by washing with 0.1% tween in PBS for 3 \\u00d7 10 min and PBS for 1 \\u00d7 5 min. The samples were postfixed with 3% formalin and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in DPBS for 10 min at RT. After a final washing step for 3 \\u00d7 5 min with DPBS and 1 \\u00d7 5 min with water, the samples were mounted with ProLong gold antifade reagent (Life Technologies) and stored in the fridge for staining. The samples were first analyzed by using a Nikon point scanning confocal A1+Si inverted microscope using a 100\\u00d7 (NA: 1.55) oil immersion objective with an image size of 1,024 \\u00d7 1,024 pixels. Excitation lasers were 405, 488, 561, and 640 nm. For the preparation of samples for dSTORM imaging, anti-A\\u03b242 (1:200) was used in combination with either anti-PSD95 diluted 1:200 or mouse anti-synaptophysin diluted 1:500. After the incubation, the dishes were washed with PBS for 3 \\u00d7 5 min. Subsequently, they were incubated with secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit IgG Fab 647 diluted 1:200 (Invitrogen) and anti-mouse IgG Atto 488 diluted 1:200, in 5% NGS in DPBS for 2\\u20133 h followed by washing with 0.1% tween in PBS for 3 \\u00d7 5 min and PBS for another 3 \\u00d7 5 min. The samples were subsequently postfixed with 3% formalin and 0.1% glutaraldehyde (Sigma) in DPBS for 10 min at RT. The final washing step was performed for 3 \\u00d7 5 min with DPBS and 1 \\u00d7 5 min with water, followed by storage in DPBS until imaging. STED imaging was performed on a Leica TCS SP8 STED 3\\u00d7 (Leica Microsystems) equipped with an HC PL APO 100\\u00d7/1.40 Oil STED WHITE objective. In brief, the fluorophores Alexa Fluor 594 and Abberior Star 635P were excited at 598 and 653 nm, respectively, and STED was performed at 775 nm for both color channels. The dye Alexa Fluor 488 was excited at 499 nm and recorded confocally. The channels were recorded sequentially. All images except the movies are raw data. No image processing, except for contrast stretching, was applied. The 3D STED data were deconvolved using Huygens deconvolution software (Scientific Volume Imaging) and rendered and animated using Imaris (Bitplane). dSTORM imaging was performed using an Elyra PS.1 microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 100\\u00d7/1.46 oil objective and a liquid cooled EMCCD camera (Andor Technology). Imaging was carried out in MEA imaging buffer as previously described (36). In short, fresh stock solutions (1 M cysteamine in 360 mM HCl, 10% glucose in PBS, 70 mg/ml glucose oxidase in PBS, and 20 mg/ml catalase in PBS) were prepared the day before imaging and stored at 4\\u00b0C and mixed directly before imaging to final concentrations of 0.124 M cysteamine (Sigma), 44.8 mM HCl, 8.6% glucose, 1.08 mg/ml glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger (Sigma), and 0.0773 mg/ml catalase from bovine liver (Sigma) in PBS. Imaging was performed in 12.8 \\u00d7 12.8-\\u03bcm areas in an inclined total internal reflection fluorescence microscope mode (37). Single molecule fluorescence detection on the EMCCD camera was acquired with 100 \\u00d7 100-nm pixel size, 20-ms Exposure time, and 100 Gain. 20,000 image frames were acquired for each channel. Both channels were imaged sequentially in 500 frame sequences and the appropriate filters and lasers for each dye were used (642 nm for Alexa Fluor 647 and 488 nm for Atto 488). The images were analyzed with the ImageJ plugin SMLocalizer (38). The relative presence of A\\u03b242 in the pre- versus postsynaptic side of the synapse was quantified from STED images of A\\u03b242, actin, and synaptophysin or PSD95 staining. The synapses to be included were selected based on the staining of actin and the synaptic markers (synaptophysin for the presynaptic side and PSD95 for the postsynaptic side). Criteria used for selecting synapses were as follows: (i) distinct spine structure (revealed by actin staining) in the plane of the slide; (ii) having a connection to a presynaptic bouton on the side; (iii) not overlapping with other dendrite or axon; and (iv) presence of a PSD cluster in the spine head (for postsynaptic localization) or synaptophysin cluster in a bouton (for presynaptic localization). The selected synapses were marked in Photoshop by yellow circles (Figs S6 and S7). A total of 73 pre- or postsynapses were selected from three to four different images. Graphs showing the proportion \\u00b1 SD of pre- and postsynapses with A\\u03b242 staining were prepared using Graphpad prism. STED images stained with A\\u03b242 (red) and synaptophysin (syp, green) combined with an actin (light grey) confocal channel. The yellow circles show synapses selected for quantification: 73 in total. Scale bars: 5 \\u03bcm. STED images stained with A\\u03b242 (red) and PSD95 (cyan) combined with an actin (light grey) confocal channel. The yellow circles show synapses selected for quantification: 73 in total. Bottom left scale bar: 5 \\u03bcm. Other scale bars: 2 \\u03bcm. The STED images of A\\u03b242/synaptophysin and synaptobrevin/synaptobrevin were analyzed using ImageJ. Presynaptic regions were manually selected as regions of interest. The threshold was set by using the Otsu algorithm, and colocalization was analyzed based on the area of staining. A total of 50 presynapses were selected for each staining combination and the percentage of A\\u03b242 or synaptobrevin colocalized with synaptophysin was displayed using Venn charts. Total stained pixels in each chart was set to 100% (Fig S4).

      "    answer: ### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "The working hypothesis is that targeting gamma secretase (GSEC) can effectively reduce the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly the pathogenic forms such as Aβ42, which are known to aggregate and form amyloid plaques in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). By inhibiting GSEC, we can potentially decrease the production of Aβ and mitigate the neurotoxic effects associated with its aggregation, thus slowing the progression of the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "Currently, there is a significant unmet medical need for effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Existing therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. With the increasing prevalence of AD and the aging population, there is an urgent requirement for disease-modifying therapies that can halt or reverse the progression of the disease. Targeting GSEC presents a promising strategy since it directly influences the production of the toxic Aβ peptides that contribute to the pathophysiology of AD.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "Combination therapy may enhance the efficacy of GSEC inhibitors. For example, combining GSEC inhibitors with beta-secretase (BACE) inhibitors could provide a more comprehensive approach to reducing Aβ levels. Additionally, pairing GSEC inhibitors with anti-inflammatory agents or other neuroprotective drugs might further mitigate the neurodegenerative processes associated with AD, potentially leading to improved clinical outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for treatment response in AD include levels of Aβ peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and amyloid PET imaging. Specifically, elevated levels of Aβ42 relative to Aβ40 in CSF or increased amyloid plaque burden seen in PET scans could serve as biomarkers to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from GSEC inhibition. Furthermore, changes in these biomarkers during treatment could help in assessing the efficacy of GSEC-targeted therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 and tau protein levels, are clinically relevant as they provide insights into the pathological state of AD. For instance, a lower ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 is often associated with increased amyloid plaque deposition. Monitoring these biomarkers can help in patient stratification for clinical trials and in understanding the disease progression, ultimately guiding treatment decisions. Furthermore, these biomarkers can be crucial in evaluating the therapeutic impact of GSEC inhibitors in clinical settings, thus enhancing the precision of AD management.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "In conclusion, targeting gamma secretase represents a promising avenue for developing disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease. The combination of innovative therapeutic strategies, predictive biomarkers, and a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of AD can pave the way for effective interventions that address both the symptoms and the root causes of this devastating disease.\n",

      "[{\"content\": \"Title: Evaluation of Virtual Screening Strategies for the Identification of \\u03b3-Secretase Inhibitors and Modulators\\n\\nAbstract: \\u03b3-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartyl protease that is important in regulating normal cell physiology via cleavage of over 100 transmembrane proteins, including Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and Notch family receptors. However, aberrant proteolysis of substrates has implications in the progression of disease pathologies, including Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD), cancers, and skin disorders. While several \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors have been identified, there has been toxicity observed in clinical trials associated with non-selective enzyme inhibition. To address this, \\u03b3-secretase modulators have been identified and pursued as more selective agents. Recent structural evidence has provided an insight into how \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators are recognized by \\u03b3-secretase, providing a platform for rational drug design targeting this protease. In this study, docking- and pharmacophore-based screening approaches were evaluated for their ability to identify, from libraries of known inhibitors and modulators with decoys with similar physicochemical properties, \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators. Using these libraries, we defined strategies for identifying both \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators incorporating an initial pharmacophore-based screen followed by a docking-based screen, with each strategy employing distinct \\u03b3-secretase structures. Furthermore, known \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators were able to be identified from an external set of bioactive molecules following application of the derived screening strategies. The approaches described herein will inform the discovery of novel small molecules targeting \\u03b3-secretase.\\n\\nFull Text: \\u03b3-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartyl protease that performs regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Type-I transmembrane (TM) proteins [1], processing over 100 functionally diverse substrates [2,3]. It is a heterotetrametric enzyme complex [4] composed of presenilin (PS, of which there are two homologues, PS1 and PS2) [5], nicastrin (Nct) [6], anterior pharynx defective-1 (Aph-1) [7], and presenilin enhancer-2 (Pen-2) [8]. The most notable substrates of \\u03b3-secretase are Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) [9] and Notch family receptors 1\\u20134 [10]. Due to its role in APP processing, \\u03b3-secretase has been investigated for the development of disease-modifying therapeutics for Alzheimer\\u2019s Disease (AD), amongst other \\u03b3-secretase related disorders [11]. These molecules are classified as \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), which target the enzyme active site, and \\u03b3-secretase modulators (GSMs) that bind to an allosteric site [12,13]. Numerous GSIs, including avagacestat and semagacestat [14,15], have progressed to clinical trials; however, they have shown off-target effects, including worsening in cognition, the development of cancers, subcutaneous tissue disorders, and gastrointestinal problems [15,16]. These associated complications are believed to be mediated by GSIs broadly inhibiting, and thereby precluding, the release of biologically important intracellular domains (ICDs) [17]. Many first generation GSIs, including L-685,458, were peptidic transition state analogs that feature hydroxyethylene dipeptide isostere moieties, allowing them to bind to \\u03b3-secretase in a way that mimics the \\u03b1-helical nature of the APP TM domain [18]. However, these molecules lack Notch-sparing activity and thus have not been pursued for development as therapeutic agents [19]. The identification of a region on the \\u03b3-secretase surface which is responsible for initial substrate binding [20] led to a focus on identifying GSIs that target the substrate-docking site of the enzyme. DAPT (N-[N-(3,5-diflurophenacetyl)-1-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester), which binds at a site that is close to the enzyme catalytic site, but remains pharmacologically distinct, was the first orally active GSI [21]. Continued optimization of this GSI class led to the development of semagacestat (a carboxamide) and avagacestat (an arylsulphonamide). These GSIs have been assessed in clinical trials against AD, showing a dose-dependent decrease in the production of A\\u03b240 and A\\u03b242 in vitro and in vivo [14,15,22]; however, participants receiving various dosages of treatments showed a higher occurrence of health complications than the placebo group and, hence, were discontinued [15,16]. In recognition of problems related to the broad inhibition of cleavage, an alternative approach was proposed to identify molecules that selectively inhibit (i.e., modulate) the production of longer neurotoxic A\\u03b2 species while maintaining ICD generation from all substrates. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the first molecules seen to modulate A\\u03b2 levels [23,24], such that there is a decrease in A\\u03b242 production alongside a simultaneous increase in the production of the shorter, less pathogenic A\\u03b238 [25]. Numerous GSMs have since been identified with this type of activity toward \\u03b3-secretase [12,26]. Neurogenetics developed the first non-NSAID GSMs, which were based around aryl- or heteroarylimidazoles and anilinothiazoles and led to the development of NGP555 [26]. This molecule binds to an allosteric interface of \\u03b3-secretase between Pen-2, Nct, and the TM 3-4 loop of PS1-NTF [27]. In vitro activity assessment by ELISA has shown NGP555 to afford a dose-dependent decrease in A\\u03b242 and A\\u03b240 production, while increasing the production of A\\u03b238, and having no significant change to the A\\u03b2 total or the generation of ICDs from other substrates [26]. This GSM has shown no associated toxicity in animal studies and has since progressed to Phase I clinical trials [27]. Analogs of the NGP555 scaffold have been identified and generally afford increased structural rigidity and metabolic stability through structural replacement and rearrangements [26,28]. However, these derivatives are similar in structure to NGP555, and there has been limited progression in the identification of new GSM molecular scaffolds. As a multi-subunit TM protein, \\u03b3-secretase has eluded structural characterization until recently. Bai et al. characterized a series of \\u03b3-secretase apo-state ensembles (PDB 5FN3, 5FN4, 5FN5) [29] by cryoelectron microscopy, alongside a complex with the GSI DAPT (PDB 5FN2, although the DAPT molecule could not be atomically resolved [29]). Of note, among these structures is the presence of a density in two apo-state ensembles (PDB 5FN3, PDB 5FN4) that could not be ascribed to \\u03b3-secretase, and is hypothesized to be unidentified co-purified substrates [29]. Compounding this, TM2, a region believed to be important for substrate binding, is missing from several of these structures (PDB 5A63, PDB 5FN4, PDB 5FN5) [29,30]. More recently, atomic structures of \\u03b3-secretase enzymes in a complex with APP (PDB 6IYC [31]) and Notch (PDB 6IDF [32]) substrates have been determined. These structures reveal the formation of an antiparallel three-stranded \\u03b2-sheet between the C-terminal portion of substrates, with two induced \\u03b2-strands, \\u03b21 (residues 287\\u2013290 when bound with APP) and \\u03b22 (377\\u2013381) from TM6 and TM7 of PS1. This structural rearrangement was not evident in the DAPT-bound \\u03b3-secretase [29] and thus is predicted to be important in substrate proteolysis and/or recognition [31,32]. The most recent structures of \\u03b3-secretase feature bound inhibitors (semagacestat, avagacestat, L685,458) and a bound modulator (E2012) (Figure 1), providing a basis to pursue structure-based drug design targeting \\u03b3-secretase [33]. Due to the historic lack of high-resolution \\u03b3-secretase structures, the design of GSIs and GSMs has been largely focused on high throughput screening and medicinal chemistry efforts to modify existing lead molecules, resulting in limited chemical diversity. The availability of high-resolution \\u03b3-secretase structures in complex with APP, Notch, and, most recently, GSIs and GSMs, provides the opportunity to use structure-based approaches for the identification of novel molecules that may have inhibitory or modulatory activity at \\u03b3-secretase. In this study, docking and pharmacophore modelling approaches were explored for their ability to reproduce the structures of inhibitors and modulators structurally co-complexed with \\u03b3-secretase, and virtual screening protocols for identifying both \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators based on these approaches were developed and validated. Docking and pharmacophore modelling were initially evaluated for their ability to reproduce the bound states of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators. Evaluation was conducted both against the cognate structure/pharmacophore, as well as against other structures/pharmacophores (Figure 2; Supplementary Materials Tables S1\\u2013S3). Glide HTVS (Figure 2A\\u2013D; Supplementary Materials Table S1) generally achieved poorly fitting poses, the only exception being for the semagacestat docked to the cognate structure (PDB 6LR4). Glide SP (Figure 2E\\u2013H; Supplementary Materials Table S2) generated well-fitting poses of E2012 against the cognate structure (PDB 7D8X), PDB 6LGQ, and PDB 6IYC; however, these poses were not highly ranked by GlideScore. Glide SP generated well-fitting poses of avagacestat against the cognate structure (PDB 6LGQ) and both structures of \\u03b3-secretase representing substrate-bound conformations (PDB 6IYC and PDB 6IDF), and, in all circumstances, these were the top-ranked poses. Glide SP generated well-fitting poses of semagacestat against all structures, although, in some circumstances (PDB 6IYC and 6LGQ), slightly better fitting poses are found lower down the ranked list (but nonetheless, still within the three best-ranked poses). Glide SP generated well-fitting poses of L685,458 only against the structure of \\u03b3-secretase representing the APP-bound conformation (PDB 6IYC), however, these are not highly ranked by GlideScore, and docking to either cognate structure (PDB 7C9I and PDB 7D8X) failed to produce well-fitting poses. While pose prediction via ePharmacophore models generally performed poorly (Figure 2I\\u2013L; Supplementary Materials Table S3), a noteworthy exception was seen for E2012 against the cognate structure (PDB 7D8X), where a well-fitting pose was achieved and ranked at the top of the list by PhaseScreenScore. Taken altogether, these results suggest the ability of Glide SP to reproduce the bound structures of traditionally drug-like \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors, while the ePharmacophore approach is preferred for predicting the bound structures of \\u03b3-secretase modulators. As Glide HTVS and ePharmacophore screening are relatively fast approaches, it is preferable to perform an initial screen of a large library by either of these methods, select highly ranked molecules, then screen the selected molecules with a slower/more accurate approach, such as Glide SP or more thorough approaches to determining binding free energy [34,35]. Thus, optimal virtual screening approaches for \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators were investigated and designed with this in mind. The ability of Glide HTVS and ePharmacophore screening to identify known inhibitors and modulators of \\u03b3-secretase from decoys generated by DUD-E was initially investigated (Table 1, Supplementary Materials Figures S1\\u2013S4). The best performing structure\\u2013method combinations for identifying \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors were to use Glide HTVS against the APP-bound conformation of \\u03b3-secretase (PDB 6IYC; AUC = 0.67, optimal MCC = 0.16 for top 7% of screen) and to screen against the ePharmacophore derived from the L685,458-bound conformation of \\u03b3-secretase (PDB 7C9I; AUC = 0.63, optimal MCC = 0.17 for top 6% of screen); the latter approach is preferred as it achieves a slightly higher MCC within a slightly smaller range of the screen. When screening for \\u03b3-secretase modulators, Glide HTVS fares poorly regardless of the structure employed, with optimal MCCs in all cases determined to be less than 0.1, suggesting near-random performance for this approach. In selected cases\\u2014specifically, PDBs 6IYC and 7D8X (\\u03b3-secretase in complex with L685,438 and the modulator E2012)\\u2014optimal MCCs above 0.1 are obtained by ePharmacophore screening, with the best performance achieved using the 7D8X-derived ePharmacophore (AUC = 0.73, MCC = 0.16 for top 7% of screen). Thus, in the context of screening for both \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and \\u03b3-secretase modulators, the ePharmacophore approach was preferred for the initial stage of screening, although with different structures being preferred for each ligand class. The respective sets of top ranked molecules following screening by the ePharmacophore approach were then screened by Glide SP at each of the \\u03b3-secretase structures (Table 2, Supplementary Materials Figures S5\\u2013S8). Noting that the correct poses for E2012 could only be accurately generated and ranked by screening against the 7D8X-derived ePharmacophore (Figure 1; Supplementary Materials Table S3), it was decided to examine whether allowing Glide SP to sample ligands in a fully flexible fashion (as is the default) or whether only to refine ePharmacophore-derived poses led to an improved enrichment of actives. When full ligand flexibility is allowed during rescreening by Glide SP, the APP-bound conformation of \\u03b3-secretase (PDB 6IYC) gives near perfect enrichment to the remaining \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (AUC = 0.99, MCC = 0.93 for top 11% of screen). With the exception of the avagacestat-bound conformation (PDB 6LQG), the remaining structures all perform excellently for enriching the remaining \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors, achieving AUCs between 0.74 and 0.97, and peak MCCs between 0.65 and 0.83. In comparison, refining the initial ePharmacophore-derived poses achieves poorer, although still excellent, results for enriching \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors from the set of top ranked molecules remaining following screening against the 7C9I-derived ePharmacophore; notably, vastly improved results are seen for screening against PDB 6LQG. In contrast to enriching \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors, the best strategy for enriching \\u03b3-secretase modulators appears to be to refine by Glide SP (i.e., not to incorporate flexible ligand sampling) the initial ePharmacophore-derived poses against PDB 7D8X (AUC = 0.70, MCC = 0.39 for top 9% of screen), which achieves a modest improvement over the best performing structure when full ligand flexibility is incorporated (for PDB 7C9I; AUC = 0.64, MCC = 0.26 for top 10% of screen). The poses of the top ranked ligands obtained from the optimal Glide SP re-screens for \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and \\u03b3-secretase modulators were then further rescored by Prime MMGBSA. This rescoring gives further enrichment of \\u03b3-secretase modulators, but fails to further enrich \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (Table 3, Supplementary Materials Figure S9). Considering the results, the optimal strategy for screening for \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors was thus chosen as being to select the top 6% of molecules obtained from screening at the 7C9I-derived ePharmacophore, followed by selecting the top 11% of this subset of molecules rescreened at PDB 6IYC by Glide SP with full ligand flexibility with no further rescoring. The \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors remaining following the application of this strategy include DAPT and semagacestat, as well as molecules with related scaffolds (Figure 3). L685,458 (which features a peptide-like scaffold as per DAPT and semagacestat) and avagacestat (which features a scaffold unrelated to all of the other structurally co-complexed \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors) are not among the known inhibitors selected. The optimal strategy for screening for \\u03b3-secretase modulators was to select the top 7% of molecules obtained from screening at the 7D8X-derived ePharmacophore, followed by selecting the top 9% of this subset of molecules rescreened at PDB 7D8X by refining ePharmacophore-derived poses with Glide SP, followed by selecting the top 24% following Prime MMGBSA rescoring of the Glide SP-rescreened subset. The \\u03b3-secretase modulators remaining following the rescreening are derived from a diverse chemical series (Figure 4) [36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44]. The optimal virtual screening strategies are summarized in Figure 5. The ability of the optimal virtual screening strategies to identify known \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and \\u03b3-secretase modulators was further investigated in the context of the ZINC15 Investigational set. This set includes several thousands of molecules with bioactivity at diverse targets, as well as a small selection of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators (including avagacestat, semagacestat, and E2012). Thus, the set forms a reasonable external library for further validation. The molecules identified from the ZINC15 Investigational set following application of the optimal virtual screening strategy for identifying \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors are listed in Table 4 (and displayed in Supplementary Materials Figure S10). Many of the molecules identified in the virtual screen are known inhibitors of other proteases. Although none of the structurally co-complexed \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors are identified in this screen, the \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor crenigacestat\\u2014structurally related to semagacestat\\u2014is among the molecules identified. With the exception of crenigacestat, it is believed that none of these molecules have been previously tested against \\u03b3-secretase, although molecules originally identified against some of the identified target classes have been demonstrated to have activity against \\u03b3-secretase, including protease inhibitors [46], kinase inhibitors [47,48], and transcription factors [49]. Shape similarity calculations between the docked solutions of the molecules listed in Table 4 and the docked conformations of avagacestat, semagacestat, and L685,458 to PDB 6IYC best fitting the respective co-complex structures (see Supplementary Materials Table S2; these structures representing suitably refined conformations of these molecules in the field of the receptor structure being used for the screen) reveal similarity between some of the selected molecules with known \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (Supplementary Materials Table S4). Specifically, limited similarity between oxacillin and avagacestat was identified (similarity score = 0.200), and limited similarity between droxinavir and L685,458 was identified (similarity score = 0.200). Several molecules were identified to have limited to moderate similarity to semagacestat, specifically Foxy-5 (similarity score = 0.216), oxacillin (similarity score = 0.264), droxinavir (similarity score = 0.302), oprozomib (similarity score = 0.410), and the known \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor crenigacestat (similarity score = 0.605). Analysis of the interactions made by the molecules bearing at least limited similarity to known \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (>0.200) with \\u03b3-secretase (Supplementary Materials Figure S11) reveal that the majority of these molecules bear polyamide functionality (or a related functionality, such as sulfonamide in the case of avagacestat, keto in the case of oprozomib, and carboxylate in the case of oxacillin) that forms hydrogen bonds with one or more of Lys380, Gly382, Leu432, and Ala434 of presenilin. Further notable interactions are made by oxacillin, which forms hydrogen bonds with the catalytic Asp385 of presenilin (modelled as neutral by PROPKA) and Foxy-5, which forms a salt bridge with Arg377 of presenilin. The molecules identified from the ZINC15 Investigational set following application of the optimal virtual screening strategy for identifying \\u03b3-secretase modulators are listed in Table 5 (and displayed in Supplementary Materials Figure S12). As per the screen of this library for identifying \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors, several of the molecules identified by the screen are also known as inhibitors of proteases. The \\u03b3-secretase modulator E2012 is among the molecules identified by the screen. Shape similarity calculations (Supplementary Materials Table S5) between the docked solutions of the molecules listed in Table 5 and the top pose of E2012 derived from fitting to the 7D8X-derived ePharmacophore (see Supplementary Materials Table S3; this structure representing the E2012 pose is the most similar to the conformation in the co-complex structure) reveal some similarity between E2012 as placed following the screen (similarity score = 0.317) and ocinaplon (similarity score = 0.244). Interaction analysis (Supplementary Materials Figure S13) reveals that E2012 and ocinaplon both form \\u03c0\\u2013\\u03c0 interactions with Phe177 of presenilin, while E2012 also forms hydrogen bonds with Tyr106 and Tyr240 of presenilin. In all cases, a substantial portion of the molecules extends out into space likely occupied by membrane lipids. The virtual screening performances for the optimal approaches largely reflect the pose prediction performance, reinforcing the importance of accurate structural predictions in achieving high performing virtual screening approaches. In particular, accurate structural predictions for \\u03b3-secretase modulators are only possible via the pharmacophore-based approach, with the best virtual screening performances being centered on the use of pharmacophore-derived poses and their subsequent refinement, rather than redocking with full ligand flexibility. The \\u03b3-secretase modulator site is unusual among drug-binding sites in that it is anticipated to be partly membrane-exposed. By comparison, the \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor site is largely enclosed within the protein, similar to the typically druggable sites of membrane proteins such as G protein-coupled receptors. Thus, the modulator site represents a type of site that is unlikely to be considered in the development of molecular docking and scoring approaches, which, in turn, may connote the use (and indeed, preference) of pharmacophore-derived poses and further refinements to these in screening for modulators. For \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors, there is a slight preference towards the use of pharmacophore-based virtual screening in the initial stage of screening, although docking generally achieves much better pose prediction performance. A challenge remains in accurately predicting the structures of peptide-like inhibitors, which may be overcome through using specialized peptide docking approaches [84,85,86], although there is evidently no difficulty in selecting such molecules by the screening approaches presented here. The virtual screening strategies presented here incorporate both ligand- and structure-based approaches, whereas these have been investigated individually in previous studies [87,88]. A further consideration of the derived strategies is that the \\u03b3-secretase structures used in this study are all bound to either drug-like ligands or substrates, which, in turn, will promote the selection of specific \\u03b3-secretase conformations and may bias certain ligand classes. In particular, where pharmacophore models are derived from considering a bound ligand, this may result in the exclusive identification of ligands similar to that against which the pharmacophore was generated. This, in turn, may account for the particular screening strategy derived for the identification of \\u03b3-secretase modulators, which centers on the use of the E2012-bound structure. While the chemotypes of \\u03b3-secretase modulators identified thus far largely center around molecules similar to E2012, the present strategy identifies molecules featuring diverse variations on this scaffold (Figure 4). We anticipate that by selecting ligands/poses satisfying a majority of pharmacophore points rather than all points (as done throughout this study), and by incorporating structures bound to different ligands/substrates (as performed for \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors), possible bias can be reduced. The application of the derived virtual screening approaches to the ZINC15 Investigational set suggests the possible general utility of the approaches. The majority of top-ranking molecules selected from the ZINC15 Investigational set in the context of screening for either \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors or \\u03b3-secretase modulators target proteases, illustrating the ability of the approaches to identify molecules with similar pharmacological functions, and the possibility of a conserved chemotype among these. Indeed, molecules previously identified as protease inhibitors at other proteins are substantially enriched by the screening approaches relative to their presence in the ZINC15 Investigational set (Supplementary Materials Figure S14). In addition to protease inhibitors, a substantial proportion of top-ranking molecules identified from the ZINC15 investigational set in the application of the \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor screening strategy target G protein-coupled receptors. While this could be a consequence of the frequent investigation of GPCRs as drug targets, it is notable, as the drug-binding sites of most GPCRs and the inhibitor site of \\u03b3-secretase are similar in that they both occur in protein cavities within the membrane, suggesting a degree of physicochemical similarity between sites and, hence, the selection by the screening approach of GPCR-targeting molecules. While the set contains a variety of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors, including all of those co-complexed with the \\u03b3-secretase structures utilized in this study, only crenigacestat, an inhibitor under investigation for its activity against Notch [89], was identified by the virtual screen. This, in turn, suggests a degree of possible bias for the selection of particular chemotypes in the virtual screening strategy, which is anticipated to be able to be addressed as new structures of \\u03b3-secretase bound to different ligands and different substrates are solved. In conclusion, we have developed multi-staged virtual screening strategies for predicting \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators. We have explored the application of docking- and pharmacophore-based approaches for both accuracy of pose prediction and screening for identifying both \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators. The derived strategies are anticipated to inform the discovery of new molecules targeting \\u03b3-secretase. Unless otherwise noted, all calculations in this study were performed using tools from Schrodinger Suite 2019-4 (Schrodinger LLC, New York, NY, USA). Structures of \\u03b3-secretase were obtained from the Protein Data Bank and are detailed in Supplementary Materials Table S6. Structures were prepared using the Protein Preparation Wizard within Maestro 12.2. Missing side chains and loops (exempting the very large intracellular loop of presenilin and the presenilin N-terminal domain) were added using Prime, and protonation states for titratable residues were determined using PROPKA [90]. Structures were subject to Impref minimization, constraining atomic coordinates to a root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) of 0.3 \\u00c5 from their starting locations. For substrate-bound structures, the substrate was removed following Impref minimization. All structures were then aligned to the structure of \\u03b3-secretase in complex with APP (PDB 6IYC). Glide High Throughput Virtual Screening (HTVS) and Standard Precision (SP) modes were considered in this study [91,92]. Docking to the inhibitor site (where L685,458, avagacestat, and semagacestat bind) and the modulator site (where E2012 binds) was performed. For \\u03b3-secretase structures with small molecules bound at either of the relevant sites, the small molecule was used to define the centroid of the docking grids. Where small molecules were not available to guide grid placement, the docking grid centroid was defined as the centroid of residues found to be within 4.0 \\u00c5 of L685,458 (to define the \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor site) or E2012 (to define the \\u03b3-secretase modulator site) in PDB 7D8X (listed in Supplementary Materials Table S7). For both modes of Glide docking, all settings were retained as defaults, with the exception that the Coulomb\\u2013van der Waals cutoff limit for pose reporting was raised to +20kcal/mol. For validation of pose prediction, it was additionally specified to report and minimize up to 100 poses per ligand, clustered to an RMSD threshold of 2.0 \\u00c5; for docking-based virtual screening, only one pose per ligand was reported (the default) and sampling was adjusted to be either Flexible (the default) or None (Refine Only). Poses were sorted by GlideScore. The ePharmacophore feature of Phase [93] was used to generate pharmacophore models against the various \\u03b3-secretase structures. For sites with bound ligands, the ligand was used directly to generate the pharmacophore model. For sites without bound ligands, pharmacophore generation was centered at the coordinates of the centroid of the residues listed in Supplementary Materials Table S7. Poses were selected that satisfied at least half of the pharmacophore points and were sorted by PhaseScreenScore [94]. Pharmacophore models derived at the \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor site are shown in Supplementary Materials Figure S15, while those derived at the \\u03b3-secretase modulator site are shown in Supplementary Materials Figure S16. The ligands bound to the various \\u03b3-secretase structures were used to facilitate validation of pose prediction by the various methods against the various structures. The RMSDs of atomic coordinates of all poses of all ligands obtained by each method against each structure were computed against the bound ligand structures. The RMSD of the top-ranked pose obtained by each method is reported, as well as the lowest RMSD for any pose obtained (referred to as best pose). Docking successes were considered RMSD values below 2.5 \\u00c5. To optimise virtual screening for identifying \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and \\u03b3-secretase modulators, a library containing known GSMs and relevant decoys was prepared, and a library containing known GSIs and relevant decoys was prepared. Known GSMs and GSIs were obtained from recent comprehensive reviews [28,45], while decoys with similar physicochemical properties to the known molecules were generated using the Database of Useful Decoys: Enhanced (DUD-E) [95]. The GSM library consisted of 78 known GSMs and 6948 decoy molecules, while the GSI library consisted of 23 known GSIs and 1173 decoy molecules. Three-dimensional (3D) structures of all molecules were prepared using LigPrep. One structure per molecule was used; if applicable, only the most likely tautomeric state at physiological pH was retained, and structures featuring the lowest energy ring conformers were retained. A multi-stage virtual screening procedure was envisioned, wherein virtual screening by one of the faster approaches (Glide HTVS or ePharmacophore screening) was applied, followed by the re-screening of selections of top-ranked ligands by progressively more thorough approaches (Glide SP, followed by Prime MMGBSA). Following this, re-screening of the top-ranked selection of ligands identified using the optimal structure\\u2013method combination by Glide SP (considering both fully flexible ligand sampling and refinement only) was performed at all structures. Finally, top ranked ligands selected by the optimal combination of structure with the Glide SP sampling approach were subject to further rescoring by Prime MMGBSA. An implicit membrane was defined using the locations of the transmembrane helices of \\u03b3-secretase and was used during the Prime MMGBSA calculations. Optimal cutoffs for selecting ligands for each stage of screening were identified using MCC, as described in \\u201cEvaluation of virtual screening performance\\u201d. Virtual screening performances were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Performance was assessed in the context of screening by each method at each protein structure/pharmacophore model at each of the inhibitor and modulator sites. Ligands were ranked according to the relevant scoring function for the method. The rates of discovery of hits and decoys were calculated at each point of the ranked list and plotted against one another, with the rate of discovery of hits considered as the true positive rate (TPR; y-axis) and the rate of discovery of decoys considered as the false positive rate (FPR; x-axis). The area under the curve (AUC) of the plots was determined by applying the trapezoid rule. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC; (1)) was calculated at each point of the ranked list, assuming the current position on the list as a cutoff for designating true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN).\\n(1)MCC=TP\\u00d7TN\\u2212FP\\u00d7FN(TP+FP)(TP+FN)(TN+FP)(TN+FN) Optimal cutoffs were reported based on the maximum MCC observed within the top 5% to top 25% of the screen. The optimal structure to use with a given approach was designated as the structure yielding the largest MCC within the lowest cutoff, i.e., an optimal result would be an MCC of 1 (perfect classification; no false positives or false negatives) at 5% of the screen. ROC and MCC calculations were conducted using LibreOffice Calc (The Document Foundation, Germany). The ZINC15 [96] Investigational set, which contains a wide range of molecules with known bioactivity at diverse targets, was used to validate the optimized virtual screening procedures. The set was downloaded from ZINC15 and prepared using LigPrep, as described in \\u201cOptimization of virtual screening for identifying \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and \\u03b3-secretase modulators\\u201d. Data on molecule generic naming and molecular targets was sourced (in order of preference) from ZINC15, ChEMBL [97], and PubChem [98]. Shape similarity calculations between the poses of the top remaining ligands and co-complexed \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors and modulators were conducted using Shape Screening within the Schrodinger Suite [99]. Calculations were conducted maintaining the molecules in place and using the typed pharmacophore volume scoring approach.\", \"metadata\": {\"paper_id\": \"8746326\", \"authors\": \"Ioppolo Alicia, Eccles Melissa, Groth David, Verdile Giuseppe, Agostino Mark\", \"year\": \"2021\", \"journal\": \"Molecules\"}}, {\"content\": \"Title: \\u03b3-Secretase inhibitors and modulators: Mechanistic insights into the function and regulation of \\u03b3-Secretase\\n\\nAbstract: Over two decades, \\u03b3-secretase has been the target for extensive therapeutic development due to its pivotal role in pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and cancer.

In this study, we attempted to determine whether \\u03b3-secretase activity regulates E-cadherin to affect glioma cell migration. The human glioma cell lines, including LN18 and LN229, and the \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors, including N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) and RO4929097, were used in this study. It was shown that \\u03b3-secretase activity inhibition by DAPT and RO4929097 could promote LN18 and LN229 glioma cell migration via downregulating E-cadherin mRNA and protein expressions, but not via affecting E-cadherin protein processing. In addition, \\u03b3-secretase activity inhibition was regulated by bone morphogenetic proteins-independent Smad5 activation in glioma cells. Moreover, endogenous Smad1 in glioma cells was found to play an important role in regulating E-cadherin expression and subsequent cell migration but did not affect DAPT-stimulated effects. These results help further elucidate the molecular mechanisms of \\u03b3-secretase activity regulation involved in controlling glioma cell malignancy. Information about a potential role for Smad1/5 activity upregulation and subsequent E-cadherin downregulation during inhibition of \\u03b3-secretase activity in the development of gliomas is therefore relevant for future research.\\n\\nFull Text: Malignant gliomas are one of the most prevalent type of central nervous system cancer in adult humans. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying malignant glioma function have been extensively investigated and current clinical treatments are multidisciplinary, including surgical resectioning, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, the median survival rates and survival outcomes are still low and are not improved in the past several decades 1-2. The most prominent reason underlying this phenomenon is the high invasiveness of malignant gliomas, with clinical observations during early diagnoses typically noting the infiltration of surrounding brain tissue by glioma cells 3-4. Moreover, the genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneities within glioma tumor masses and stem cell-like characteristics of the glioma cells contribute to their aggressive invasiveness, infiltration, and migration. Such heterogeneity can also lead to the development of drug resistance 5-10. A more detailed investigation of the mechanisms underlying the invasive behavior of gliomas is thus still an urgent and important issue to investigate in order to improve glioma-targeting therapies. \\u03b3-secretases are multisubunit protein complexes that cleave type I transmembrane proteins, including p75, Notch, and N-/E-cadherin 11-12. To date, over 100 substrates for \\u03b3-secretases have been found and, notably, most of these substrates play important but distinct functions in developing and adult tissues. It has therefore been suggested that the regulation of \\u03b3-secretase activity may control a large variety of cellular events 11-12. \\u03b3-secretase has been an increasingly relevent potential therapeutic target since its role in Alzheimer's disease has been identified. In addition, cleavage of multiple substrates by \\u03b3-secretase has been implicated in cancer development. For example, p75 cleavage is linked to gliomas, Notch cleavage is connected to many types of cancers (including breast and non-small-cell lung cancer), and E-cadherin cleavage is associated with colorectal cancer 1-2, 15-19. A number of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors for clinical application have thus been developed. However, ensuring the specificity of these therapeutic \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors is difficult because of the wide variety of \\u03b3-secretase substrates, which are involved in many different signaling pathways and cellular events. The role of \\u03b3-secretases in gliomas is clinically relevant because accumulating data indicate that many \\u03b3-secretase substrates, including p75, Notch, and N-/E-cadherin, may regulate glioma pathogenesis and malignancy 15, 20-21. Thus, additional molecular understanding of how \\u03b3-secretases regulate glioma development is critical for developing future treatment strategies. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which are originally identified as bone-growth inducers, have been indicated as context-dependent stimulators now because of their multifunctional roles in physiological and pathophysiological processes in multiple tissue types. BMPs bind to their specific membrane receptors, activate Smad1/5 signaling and then regulate the target genes transcriptions 22. BMP signaling has also been found to act as either an inducer or repressor in different types of cancers 23-24. Moreover, in addition to playing a major role in neural development, recently, BMP signaling has also been linked to malignant glioma 22, 25-26. However, their precise role and mechanism are still unclear. BMP signaling and Notch/cadherin (\\u03b3-secretases substrates) signaling have been proposed to have important related functions in various cell types 27-28. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the functional and regulatory relationships between \\u03b3-secretases and BMP signaling in glioma cells. N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) and RO4929097 are two of the most widely used \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors 18, 29. In the present study, we investigate whether inhibition of \\u03b3-secretases activity by DAPT and RO4929097 decreases N-/E-cadherin protein processing, subsequently inhibiting glioma cell migration. However, it was surprisingly found that DAPT and RO4929097 unexpectedly inhibited E-cadherin (not N--cadherin) mRNA/protein expression and consequently promoted glioma cell migration via BMP-independent Smad5 activation. Our findings elucidate a possible role and mechanism for \\u03b3-secretase activity inhibition in regulating E-cadherin transcription and glioma cell migration, which may be relevant for future development of drugs targeting malignant gliomas. DAPT was purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). RO4929097 was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Noggin was purchased from BioLegend (San Diego, USA). All other chemicals of reagent grade were obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). LN18 and LN229 human glioma cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were cultured as a monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) and maintained at 37 \\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Total cellular RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Ltd, QIAGEN #74104) following the manufacturer's instructions. A total volume of 20 \\u03bcl of cDNA was then prepared by reverse transcribing 2 \\u03bcg of total cellular RNA using the SuperScript IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen #18091050) using 20-mer oligo (dT) primers. Quantitative real-time PCR was then performed using a Quantinova SYBR GREEN PCR Kit (QIAGEN #208154). \\u03b2-actin mRNA expression was used as an internal control. The sequences of oligonucleotide primers used for human E-cadherin and \\u03b2-actin amplification were as follows: E-cadherin: 5'-TGCTCACATTTCCCAACTCC-3' and 5'-TTGCCTTCTTTCTCTTTGTT-3'; \\u03b2-actin: 5'-ATGATATCGCCGCGCTCGT-3' and 5'-CGCTCGGTGAGGATCTTCA-3'. Each experiment was done in triplicate at minimum and the results are representative of at least three separate experiments. Western blotting was performed as previously described. Quantified cell lysates were suspended in cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA)). After centrifugation at 12000 rpm and 4 \\u00b0C, proteins were resolved on a 7% SDS-PAGE gel then transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membrane was then blocked with 8% non-fat milk for 2 hours at room temperature and probed with primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution) at 4 \\u00b0C overnight. The primary antibodies used in this study were: anti-E-cadherin (BD610181) and anti-N-cadherin (BD610920)(BD Biosciences, San Jose, California, USA), anti-p-Smad1/5/9 (#13820; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), anti-Smad1/5/9 (sc-6031-R; Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and anti-\\u03b2-actin (A5441; Sigma-Aldrich). Membrane was then rinsed with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were visualized using a SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate kit (Pierce, Waltham, MA, USA) and quantified using ImageJ software. The protein expression and phosphorylation levels were nomalized with the \\u03b2-actin and total proteins, respectively, and the DAPT-/RO4929097-treated groups were compared to the untreated control group. The cytosolic, membrane and nuclear proteins were isolated and purified according to the protocols of the FractionPREP cell isolation kit (BioVision, Milpitas, California, USA). Fractionation results were further confirmed by Western blot with specific antibodies for GAPDH (a cytosol marker), Na+/K+-ATPase (a membrane marker) and YY1 (a nuclear marker). Migration assays were performed in Boyden chambers using polyethylene terephthalate membranes with 8 \\u03bcm pores with Falcon cell-culture inserts (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. In brief, cells (5\\u00d7104) were seeded on the upper wells and allowed to migrate through the membrane at 37 \\u00b0C in humidified air with 5% CO2. After 24 h, the filter membrane between the top and bottom chambers was removed. The cells on the lower surface of the membrane were fixed in methanol and then stained with 1% Crystal violet. The cells in at least five randomly selected fields were photographed under a microscope and counted. The data are presented as mean \\u00b1 SD. Migration assay was performed by wound-healing experiment by using the two-well culture-insert (Ibidi, Grafelfing, Bavaria, Germany). In brief, cells were cultured in the both wells of culture-insert. After stimulation, the culture-inserts were removed to allow cell migration. After 24 h, the migration levels were photographed in the microscope and images were quantified. Commercial siRNAs targeting human Smad1 and Smad5 were used for transfection experiments (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cells at ~80% confluence were transfected with the indicated 20 nM siRNA (si-control, si-Smad1 or si-Smad5) using the Lipofactamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Scrambled sequence siRNAs were used as negative controls. Data in the figures and text are representative of three independent experiments and are expressed as the mean \\u00b1 SD. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical software package (SPSS/PC+, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Inter-group comparisons of continuous variables were analyzed with Student's ttest or analysis of variance (ANOVA). A two-tailed P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. N-cadherin and E-cadherin play important role in cell junctions and cancer metastasis. It has been found that cleavage of N-/E-cadherin by \\u03b3-secretase may help initiate the migration of cancer cells 18, 21. We assessed whether blocking \\u03b3-secretase activity by specific inhibitors, i.e., DAPT and RO4929097, affects N-/E-cadherin levels in human glioma cells. LN18 glioma cells were kept as controls or treated with DAPT (20, 40, or 80 \\u03bcM) for 24 h and 48 h and then N-/E-cadherin protein and mRNA levels were examined. It was shown that DAPT causes downregulations of E-cadherin protein (Fig. 1A) and mRNA (Fig. 1B) levels in LN18 glioma cells in the dose- and time-dependent manners. However, DAPT did not affect N-cadherin protein levels (Fig. 1A). LN18 glioma cells treated with 1 \\u03bcM RO4929097 (Fig. 1C, left panels) or LN229 glioma cells treated with 80 \\u03bcM DAPT (Fig. 1C, right panels) showed similar inhibitory effects on E-cadherin protein expressions. Moreover, the results from protein localization assay showed that membrane E-cadherin protein level could be significantly decreased in LN18 glioma cells treated with both types of \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors (Fig. 1D). The migration levels of glioma cells were examined by using chemotaxis and wound-healing methods. LN18 glioma cells were kept as controls (CL) or treated with 80 \\u03bcM DAPT for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h and then cell migration was examined by chemotaxis method. LN18 glioma cells treated with DAPT resulted in a significant increase in cell migration in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The numbers of migrated cells reached to a maximal level after 96 h of treatment compared to the untreated control cells, which were ~3 folds of untreated control cells. Both LN18 and LN229 glioma cells were kept as controls or treated with 80 \\u03bcM DAPT or 1 \\u03bcM RO4929097 for 48 or 96 h and then cell migration was examined by chemotaxis (Fig. 2B) and wound-healing (Fig. 3) methods. It was shown that both \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors, i.e., DAPT and RO4929097, have similar promoted effect on cell migration levels of LN18 (upper panels in Fig. 2B and Fig. 3A) and LN229 (down panels in Fig. 2B and Fig. 3B) glioma cells. BMP and Smad1/5 signaling may play important roles in glioma development 22, 25-26. LN18 glioma cells were kept as controls or treated with 80 \\u03bcM DAPT for 0.5 h, 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, or 24 h and then Smad1/5 phosphorylation were examined. Treating cells with DAPT increased Smad1/5 phosphorylation within 0.5 h of treatment in LN18 glioma cells, with phosphorylation peaking within 1 h and returning to basal levels after 4 h of treatment (Fig. 4A). LN18 glioma cells were pretreated with control (siCL), Smad1 (siSmad1)-, or Smad5 (siSmad5)-specific siRNAs and then were kept as controls or treated with 80 \\u03bcM DAPT for 48 h. Treatment with either Smad1- or Smad5-specific siRNAs resulted in ~50-80% reductions in target protein expression levels. The knockdown of Smad5 prevented DAPT-dependent repression of E-cadherin protein (Fig. 4B) and mRNA (Fig. 4C) levels in LN18 glioma cells compared to cells co-treated with control siRNA and DAPT. In addition, cells pretreated with Smad1-specific siRNA increased the basal endoenous E-cadherin protein (Fig. 4B) and mRNA (Fig. 4C) expressions in DAPT-untreated cells, and the DAPT treatment also further downregulated E-cadherin expressions in LN18 glioma cells (Fig. 4B and 4C). Smad1/5 are involved in signaling pathways downstream of BMPs; therefore, we examined whether the effect of DAPT on Smad5-E-cadherin is regulated by BMPs autocrine stimulation. Cells were pretreated with either DMSO or Noggin, a BMP-specific antagonist, for 1 h and then were kept as controls or treated with 80 \\u03bcM DAPT for 48 h. It was shown that Noggin does not affect the inhibition of E-cadherin expression by DAPT in LN18 glioma cells (Fig. 4D). LN18 glioma cells were pretreated with control (siCL), Smad1 (siSmad1)-, or Smad5 (siSmad5)-specific siRNA and then were kept as controls or treated with 80 \\u03bcM DAPT for 48 or 96 h and then cell migration was examined by chemotaxis (Fig. 5A) and wound-healing (Fig. 5B) methods. It was shown that the gene knockdown of Smad5 significantly recovered the DAPT-promoted LN18 glioma cell migration compared to the cells-cotreating with control-specific siRNA and DAPT (Fig. 5A and 5B). Cells pretreated with Smad1-specific siRNA decreased the basal migration level in DAPT-untreated cells, and the DAPT treatment also further promoted LN18 glioma cell migration (Fig. 5A). Finally, we determine whether endogenous E-cadherin affects glioma cell migration. LN18 and LN229 glioma cells were treated with control (siCL) or E-cadherin (siE-cadherin)-specific siRNA for 96 h and then cell migration was examined by chemotaxis methods. It was shown that the gene knockdown of E-cadherin significantly increases the migration levels of both types of cells compared to the cells-treating with control-specific siRNA (Fig. 6A). Cells treated with E-cadherin-specific siRNA resulted in ~60% reductions in target gene expression level (Fig. 6B). This study has surprisingly revealed an unexpected role of \\u03b3-secretase activity inhibition by DAPT and RO4929097 in promoting glioma cell migration (summarized in Fig. 7). The systematic experiments demonstrated that (i) DAPT and RO4929097 downregulate E-cadherin (not N-cadherin) protein and mRNA expressions and subsequently promotes LN18 and LN229 glioma cells migration. (ii) This DAPT/RO4929097 effect on glioma cells is regulated by BMPs-independent Smad5 (not Smad1) activation. (iii) endogenous Smad1 plays a critical role in E-cadherin expression and consequent migration of glioma cells. Our findings provide new insights into the potential migration-promoting role of \\u03b3-secretase activity inhibition in malignant glioma. E-cadherin, a critical adherens junction protein, is a well-established \\u03b3-secretase substrate 11. The cleavage of E-cadherin by \\u03b3-secretase induces disassembly of the adherens junction complex (made up of E-cadherin and \\u03b2-catenin), resulting in intercellular junction disruption and the release of soluble \\u03b2-catenin into the cytosol and nucleus to regulate Wnt signaling 12, 18. \\u03b2-catenin released from \\u03b3-secretase cleavage of E-cadherin junction complexes in bone marrow stromal cells enhances osteoinduction during bone healing 30. In contrast, intercellular junction disruption by \\u03b3-secretase cleavage of E-cadherin is associated with metastasis and malignance of cancers, especially for breast cancer 18, 31-32. Because of this association, it has proposed that blocking \\u03b3-secretase activity in breast cancer cells should be tested in pharmacological studies. In our study, DAPT and RO4929097, two commonly used \\u03b3-secretase inhibitors, promoted glioma cell migration. Moreover, we found that the effects of DAPT/RO4929097 are mediated by the repression of E-cadherin mRNA and protein levels. This finding is surprising. In glioma cells, \\u03b3-secretase has been indicated as a potential therapeutic target because its enzymatic cleavage on another substrates, i.e., p75 and Notch, has been associated with glioma metastasis 15-16, 20. However, our study suggested another possible of DAPT effect on glioma cell migration, which is through E-cadherin expression regulation. Recently, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and shifts in E- and N-cadherin expression have been linked to glioma metastasis 33-35. Additionally, in clinical cases, N-cadherin expression appears to positively correlate with increasing grades of malignant gliomas 33. However, in contrast to N-cadherin, E-cadherin expression is low and its exact role in glioma cells is still unclear. Considering the information available, we proposed that although the level of E-cadherin in glioma cells is lower than that of N-cadherin, E-cadherin helps promote glioma cell migration. We also propose that although the effect of DAPT/RO4929097 on E-cadherin in glioma cells is through regulation of protein/mRNA expression levels, it is possible that DAPT/RO4929097 also affects other \\u03b3-secretase substrates to mediate this effect on E-cadherin. Finally, it is still unclear whether the high heterogeneity of glioma cells present leads to different outcomes upon \\u03b3-secretase activity inhibition. All of these questions should be further investigated to provide improved mechanistic explanations underlying glioma cell function. It has recently been indicated that BMPs likely have a regulatory role in gliomas and thus have potential therapeutic capabilities. For example, BMP4 is able to promote differentiation, inhibit proliferation, and decrease tumorigenicity of glioma stem cells 25, 36. Additionally, BMP7 can suppress the tumorigenicity of stem-like glioblastoma cells 37. However, some studies have demonstrated positive correlations between BMP expression and the malignant grade of gliomas 38-39. Our present study indicates that the repression of E-cadherin mRNA and protein expression via DAPT treatment in glioma cells is regulated by BMP-independent Smad5 activation. We can exclude the possibility of autocrine BMP effects on DAPT-treated glioma cells because the BMP antagonist Noggin did not affect the repression of E-cadherin expression through Smad5 by DAPT treatment. Moreover, our findings indicate that although Smad1 is not involved in regulating DAPT inhibition of E-cadherin expression, basal endogenous Smad1 levels can regulate E-cadherin expression and subsequent glioma cell migration. This suggests that endogenous Smad1 may have a regulatory role in glioma cells. Although Smad1/5 signaling is a well-known downstream pathway from BMPs, accumulating evidence suggests that Smad1/5 signaling can also be activated independently of BMPs. For example, TGF\\u03b2 and mechanical forces may also induce Smad1/5 phosphorylation without BMP stimulation 40-41. Further research is therefore needed to further examine whether DAPT affects the processing of other \\u03b3-secretase substrates and modulation of Smad1/5 signaling. Our present study showed that Smad1/5 phosphorylation in LN18 glioma cells only persists for ~4 h after DAPT stimulation. But, the DAPT-elicited E-cadherin downregulation and subsequent glioma cell migration could persist for more than 24-96 h. Although the results from Smad1/5 gene knockdown experiments already confirmed the importeant role of Smad1/5 in DAPT effect on E-cadherin expression and glioma cell migration, the other signaling regulators, including others \\u03b3-secretase's substrates, mediating this time gap should be further elucidated in future. Moreover, the present results showed that only Smad5 could regulate E-cadherin expression in DAPT-treated glioma cells. And, although endogenous Smad1 itself could also affect E-cadherin expression, it shouldn't be the downstream mediator of DAPT. Smad1 and Smad5 have been found to share high amino acid identity and structure similarity. Most studies have demonstrated their similar activities and possible compensative mechanisms in regulating cell functions. However, in constrast, Smad1 and Smad5 have also been indicated to probably contribute to the diverse roles in the embryogenesis and hematopoiesis 42-43. It has been further elucidated that Smad1/5 activity might be affected and controlled by the different ligand stimulations and different membrane receptors and/or intracellular signaling proteins associations 44. Thus, these findings might support our results about distinct roles of Smad1 and Smad5 in DAPT-treated glioma cells, but their exact mechanisms still need more clear examination. This study reported that \\u03b3-secretase activity inhibition by DAPT/RO4929097 in LN18 and LN229 glioma cells promotes glioma cell migration by inhibiting E-cadherin mRNA and protein levels through BMP-independent Smad5 activation. These results provide new insights into the complex role of \\u03b3-secretase and its substrates in glioma metastasis regulation. Moreover, although E-cadherin levels in glioma cells are extremely low, our results demonstrate an important role for E-cadherins in regulating malignant gliomas. Additionally, we found that endogenous Smad1 may have a regulatory role in glioma cells. Our present study thus indicates the need for further elucidation of pathways related to glioma cell development and future clinical developments.\", \"metadata\": {\"paper_id\": \"8176174\", \"authors\": \"Chang Shun-Fu, Yang Wei-Hsun, Cheng Chun-Yu, Luo Sheng-Jie, Wang Ting-Chung\", \"year\": \"2021\", \"journal\": \"International Journal of Medical Sciences\"}}]\n",

      "    answer: ### Working Hypothesis\n",
      "The working hypothesis is that targeting gamma secretase (GSEC) can effectively reduce the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, particularly the pathogenic forms such as Aβ42, which are known to aggregate and form amyloid plaques in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). By inhibiting GSEC, we can potentially decrease the production of Aβ and mitigate the neurotoxic effects associated with its aggregation, thus slowing the progression of the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unmet Medical Need\n",
      "Currently, there is a significant unmet medical need for effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Existing therapies primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing the underlying pathology. With the increasing prevalence of AD and the aging population, there is an urgent requirement for disease-modifying therapies that can halt or reverse the progression of the disease. Targeting GSEC presents a promising strategy since it directly influences the production of the toxic Aβ peptides that contribute to the pathophysiology of AD.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suitability for Combination Therapy\n",
      "Combination therapy may enhance the efficacy of GSEC inhibitors. For example, combining GSEC inhibitors with beta-secretase (BACE) inhibitors could provide a more comprehensive approach to reducing Aβ levels. Additionally, pairing GSEC inhibitors with anti-inflammatory agents or other neuroprotective drugs might further mitigate the neurodegenerative processes associated with AD, potentially leading to improved clinical outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictive Biomarkers\n",
      "Predictive biomarkers for treatment response in AD include levels of Aβ peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and amyloid PET imaging. Specifically, elevated levels of Aβ42 relative to Aβ40 in CSF or increased amyloid plaque burden seen in PET scans could serve as biomarkers to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from GSEC inhibition. Furthermore, changes in these biomarkers during treatment could help in assessing the efficacy of GSEC-targeted therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Relevance of Existing Biomarkers\n",
      "Existing biomarkers, such as the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 and tau protein levels, are clinically relevant as they provide insights into the pathological state of AD. For instance, a lower ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 is often associated with increased amyloid plaque deposition. Monitoring these biomarkers can help in patient stratification for clinical trials and in understanding the disease progression, ultimately guiding treatment decisions. Furthermore, these biomarkers can be crucial in evaluating the therapeutic impact of GSEC inhibitors in clinical settings, thus enhancing the precision of AD management.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "In conclusion, targeting gamma secretase represents a promising avenue for developing disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease. The combination of innovative therapeutic strategies, predictive biomarkers, and a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of AD can pave the way for effective interventions that address both the symptoms and the root causes of this devastating disease.\n",

      "[{\"content\": \"Title: CNS axonal degeneration and transport deficits at the optic nerve head precede structural and functional loss of retinal ganglion cells in a mouse model of glaucoma\\n\\nAbstract: Glaucoma is a leading neurodegenerative disease affecting over 70 million individuals worldwide. Early pathological events of axonal degeneration and retinopathy in response to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) are limited and not well-defined due to the lack of appropriate animal models that faithfully replicate all the phenotypes of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common form of glaucoma. Glucocorticoid (GC)-induced ocular hypertension (OHT) and its associated iatrogenic open-angle glaucoma share many features with POAG. Here, we characterized a novel mouse model of GC-induced OHT for glaucomatous neurodegeneration and further explored early pathological events of axonal degeneration in response to elevated IOP. C57BL/6\\u2009J mice were periocularly injected with either vehicle or the potent GC, dexamethasone 21-acetate (Dex) once a week for 10\\u2009weeks. Glaucoma phenotypes including IOP, outflow facility, structural and functional loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), optic nerve (ON) degeneration, gliosis, and anterograde axonal transport deficits were examined at various stages of OHT. Prolonged treatment with Dex leads to glaucoma in mice similar to POAG patients including IOP elevation due to reduced outflow facility and dysfunction of trabecular meshwork, progressive ON degeneration and structural and functional loss of RGCs. Lowering of IOP rescued Dex-induced ON degeneration and RGC loss, suggesting that glaucomatous neurodegeneration is IOP dependent. Also, Dex-induced neurodegeneration was associated with activation of astrocytes, axonal transport deficits, ON demyelination, mitochondrial accumulation and immune cell infiltration in the optic nerve head (ONH) region. Our studies further show that ON degeneration precedes structural and functional loss of RGCs in Dex-treated mice. Axonal damage and transport deficits initiate at the ONH and progress toward the distal end of ON and target regions in the brain (i.e. superior colliculus). Most of anterograde transport was preserved during initial stages of axonal degeneration (30% loss) and complete transport deficits were only observed at the ONH during later stages of severe axonal degeneration (50% loss). These findings indicate that ON degeneration and transport deficits at the ONH precede RGC structural and functional loss and provide a new potential therapeutic window for rescuing neuronal loss and restoring health of damaged axons in glaucoma.\\n\\nFull Text: Glaucoma is a heterogeneous group of optic neuropathies characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerve degeneration that results in irreversible vision loss [1]. According to 2013 global estimates, 64.3 million people (aged 40 to 80\\u2009years) have glaucoma, and this number is estimated to reach 111.8 million by 2040 [2, 3] imposing a major threat to global health [4]. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glaucoma, accounting for at least 74% of all cases [5]. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most important and only known modifiable risk factor associated with POAG [6\\u20138]. Under normal conditions, IOP is tightly regulated via balance of aqueous humor (AH) production by the ciliary body and its outflow through trabecular meshwork (TM) tissue [9, 10]. Increased resistance to AH outflow due to TM dysfunction is responsible for IOP elevation in POAG [11, 12]. The glaucomatous damage is associated with characteristic biochemical and morphological changes in the TM [13, 14]. Chronic IOP elevation leads to glaucomatous neurodegeneration including loss of RGCs and optic nerve degeneration, resulting in irreversible vision loss [12]. Despite therapeutic reduction of IOP, vision loss still continues to progress in most glaucoma patients [15\\u201317]. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand early pathological events of glaucomatous neurodegeneration, which can be effectively targeted along with IOP lowering treatments to prevent vision loss. In order to understand the pathophysiology of glaucomatous neurodegeneration and to develop targeted neuroprotective agents, it is essential to develop simple and reliable animal models that can faithfully replicate human POAG. Since the structural and functional anatomy of the conventional outflow pathway and AH outflow dynamics are similar between human and mouse eyes [18], several mouse models of ocular hypertension (OHT) have been developed. These mouse models include spontaneous mutant DBA/2\\u2009J mice and inducible mouse models that elevate IOP via physical blockage of AH outflow through the TM or block the pupil to prevent inflow of AH into the anterior chamber [19\\u201324]. These models exhibit RGC cell death and optic nerve degeneration and have been instrumental in providing valuable mechanistic insights of glaucomatous neurodegeneration. However, several aspects of glaucoma cannot be studied in these models. Since most of these models elevate IOP by physically blocking outflow pathway [21\\u201323], they do not faithfully reproduce human POAG conditions in which the outflow pathway is open. Silicon oil induces OHT by blocking the pupil which prevents inflow of AH into the anterior chamber without damaging any ocular tissues and leads to secondary open angle glaucoma. It is likely that the pathophysiology of glaucomatous neurodegeneration due to chronic IOP elevation observed in POAG is different than these established models and these human POAG pathways can be explored more effectively utilizing mouse models that mimic POAG. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel mouse model of chronic and mild OHT-induced glaucomatous neurodegeneration that mimics human POAG. OHT is a serious adverse effect of glucocorticoid (GC) therapy [18, 25\\u201327], and GCs are widely used to treat various inflammatory and immune mediated systemic, local, and ocular diseases [18]. Topical or systemic administration of potent GCs (such as dexamethasone or betamethasone) for 4 to 6\\u2009weeks cause OHT in approximately 30 to 40% of the general population [28, 29]. If left untreated, prolonged GC-induced OHT can lead to glaucomatous optic neuropathy and vision loss [25]. GC responsiveness is significantly higher in POAG patients. Strikingly, the morphological and clinical features of GC-induced OHT and its associated iatrogenic open-angle glaucoma closely resembles POAG [29\\u201331]. Similar to POAG, GCs also cause morphological and biochemical changes in the TM including extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling [32\\u201334], altered cytoskeleton changes [35] and reduced phagocytic activity [36]. Since GC-induced OHT and its associated iatrogenic open-angle glaucoma share many features of POAG, several laboratories have attempted to develop mouse models of GC-induced glaucoma [37\\u201339]. Most of these studies were limited to GC-induced OHT and outflow facility obstructions, however IOP elevation induced in these models is mild and may not be sufficient to cause glaucomatous neurodegeneration. We have recently developed a simple and reproducible mouse model of GC-induced OHT using periocular injections of dexamethasone-21-acetate (Dex) [40]. It is important to determine whether Dex-induced OHT is sustained and sufficient to develop glaucomatous neurodegeneration, similar to human POAG. Here, we show that prolonged Dex treatment leads to IOP dependent glaucomatous neurodegeneration including significant structural and functional loss of RGCs as well as optic nerve degeneration. Using this model, we further sought to study early pathological events of optic nerve degeneration in response to elevated IOP. We show that RGC soma and most of the anterograde transport mechanism persist despite initial optic nerve degeneration. RGC soma loss and complete transport deficits were observed only after severe optic nerve degeneration. Three-month old male C57BL/6\\u2009J mice obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) were used in our study. Animals were fed standard chow ad libitum and housed under controlled conditions of temperature (21\\u2009\\u00b0C to 26\\u2009\\u00b0C), humidity (40 to 70%) and maintained on a 12\\u2009h light/12\\u2009h dark cycle. The number of mice utilized in each experiment is denoted in the representative figures or figure legends. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) (Protocol #: IACUC-2018-0032). Mice were euthanized by inhalation of carbon dioxide followed by cervical dislocation as approved by institutional IACUC protocol. Dex suspension was prepared by mixing 10\\u2009mg of micronized Dex-Acetate (Spectrum Chemicals, New Brunswick, NJ) in 1\\u2009mL of vehicle (Veh) suspension. Ingredients and preparation of vehicle suspension was described previously [40]. A uniform suspension with desired Dex particle size was achieved by mixing the suspension along with two stainless steel 5-mm beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in a TissueLyser LT (Qiagen) for 10\\u2009min at 50 oscillations/sec and further rotated overnight at 4\\u2009\\u00b0C until use. Mice under anesthetic conditions (isoflurane (2.5%); oxygen (0.8\\u2009L/min)) were injected weekly with 20\\u2009\\u03bcL/eye of either Veh or freshly made Dex (i.e. 200\\u2009\\u03bcg) suspension via the periocular route using a 32-gauge needle attached to a Hamilton glass micro syringe. For most experiments both eyes were injected with either Veh or Dex (bilateral). To study axonal transport, one eye was injected with Veh while the contralateral eye was injected with Dex. IOPs were measured under anesthetic conditions (isoflurane (2.5%); oxygen (0.8\\u2009L/min)) using a TonoLab rebound tonometer (Colonial Medical Supply, Franconia, NH). Both day and night-time IOPs were monitored once a week throughout the treatment periods. IOP measurements were recorded in a masked manner and an average of six IOP readings were taken at each time period. In addition, dark-adopted night-time IOPs were performed as described previously [41]. IOP measurements were completed within 4\\u2009min in order to avoid the effect of isoflurane on IOP. Outflow facilities in Veh and Dex-injected mice were measured using the constant-flow infusion technique as described previously [42]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine solution (100/10\\u2009mg/kg) and body temperature was maintained at physiological levels by placing mice on a 37\\u2009\\u00b0C heating pad during the entire procedure. Topical ocular proparacaine HCl (0.5%) eye drops were applied to both eyes for corneal anesthesia. Anterior chambers were cannulated with a 30-gauge needles through cornea without touching the iris, anterior lens capsule or corneal endothelium. The cannulated needles were connected to a pre-calibrated flow-through BLPR-2 pressure transducer and maintained continuous pressure within the perfusion system. The opposing end of the transducer was connected to a 1\\u2009mL syringe loaded into a microdialysis infusion pump. The entire perfusion system was filled with sterile phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Eyes were infused at a flow rate of 0.1\\u2009\\u03bcL/min to 0.5\\u2009\\u03bcL/min (in 0.1\\u2009\\u03bcL/min increments), and three stabilized pressures at 5\\u2009min intervals were recorded for each flow rate. An average of these three stabilized pressures was considered as a mean stabilized pressure. Aqueous humor outflow facility was calculated as the reciprocal of the slope of a plot of mean stabilized pressure as the ordinate and flow rate as the abscissa. Ocular abnormalities and inflammation in Veh and Dex-injected eyes were examined using slit-lamp microscopy (SL-D7; Topcon) and photo-documented with a digital camera (D100; Nikon). Mice were subjected to intracardiac perfusion of PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in order to fix ocular and/or extra-ocular tissues. Briefly, mice were weighed and then anesthetized with an injectable anesthetic cocktail (ketamine 100\\u2009mg/kg; xylazine 10\\u2009mg/kg; acepromazine 3\\u2009mg/kg (administered I.P., 1\\u2009mL/100\\u2009g)). Absence of flexor withdrawal response, a tail pinch, and the palbebral (blink) reflex was assessed and then intracardiac perfusion was performed. After intracardiac perfusion, absence of respiration and heartbeat was confirmed, and a unilateral thoracotomy was performed. Following the thoracotomy, ocular and/or extra-ocular tissues were dissected carefully and fixed in 4% PFA for 12\\u2009h at 4\\u2009\\u00b0C. As described previously [43], paraffin embedded mouse or human tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated gradually by washing with 100, 95, 70, 50% ethanol for 5\\u2009min\\u00a0in each. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating the sections in citrate buffer (pH\\u20096.0) at 100\\u2009\\u00b0C for 13\\u2009min, followed by an incubation with citrate buffer (pH\\u20096.0) for 30\\u2009min at room temperature. For OCT embedded cryosections, sections without antigen retrieval were incubated directly in blocking buffer (PBS containing 10% goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100) for 2\\u2009h in a dark and humidified chamber. Note that depending on the tissue type, the concentration of Triton X-100 varied from 0.2 to 2%. Tissue sections were washed briefly and incubated overnight with specific primary antibodies at 4\\u2009\\u00b0C. Following 3 washes in PBS, sections were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 2\\u2009h at room temperature. Tissue sections were washed with PBS and mounted with mounting medium containing DAPI nuclear stain (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA). Images were captured using a Keyence fluorescence microscope (Itasca, IL, USA) and processed in ImageJ [44]. Tissue sections incubated without primary antibody served as a negative control and the relative signal intensities were subtracted with averaged background intensity.

Whole-mount retina staining with RBPMS antibody was performed to examine the total number of surviving RGCs in Veh and Dex-injected mice. Briefly, eyes were enucleated from euthanized mice and fixed in 4% PFA for 12\\u2009h at 4\\u2009\\u00b0C. After rinsing the eyeball in PBS, the anterior chamber was removed, and retina was carefully separated from the posterior cup. Isolated retinas were incubated in blocking buffer (PBS containing 10% goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100) for 12\\u2009h at 4\\u2009\\u00b0C. Retinas were incubated with RBPMS antibody for 3\\u2009days at 4\\u2009\\u00b0C and washed for 2\\u2009h in PBS. After washing, retinas were incubated with a corresponding secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit 568, 1:500; Invitrogen) for 2\\u2009h at room temperature, washed for 1\\u2009h in PBS and then mounted with mounting medium containing DAPI nuclear stain. For counting RGCs, at least 16 non-overlapping images from the entire retina were captured at 200x magnification using a Keyence fluorescence microscope (Itasca, IL, USA) and RBPMS-positive cells were counted using ImageJ software [44]. To examine reactive astrocytes in the retina, we incubated whole-mount retina with GFAP antibody along with RBPMS. Axonal anterograde transport deficits was analyzed by cholera toxin B (CTB) labelling. Following 5, 8- or 10-weeks post injections, mice were anesthetized and injected intravitreally with 3\\u2009\\u03bcL of 0.1% CTB (reconstituted in PBS) conjugated with either Alexa fluor 555 or Alexa fluor 480 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) using a Hamilton syringe with a 33-gauge needle. After 48\\u2009h, mice were euthanized, and eyes and brains were enucleated and fixed in 4% PFA for 12\\u2009h at 4\\u2009\\u00b0C. Fixed eyes and brains were washed in PBS and incubated in gradient concentrations of sucrose solution (10 to 30%) for an additional 3\\u2009days, and then embedded in OCT compound and cryo-sectioned at 10\\u2009\\u03bcm thickness. For visualizing the axonal anterograde transport of CTB in the SC, serial frontal sections of brain were taken at 30\\u2009\\u03bcm thickness. All the sections were washed with PBS, mounted with mounting medium containing DAPI nuclear stain and images were captured at the same laser intensities using a Keyence fluorescence microscope. PPD staining was used to examine the optic nerve degeneration in Veh and Dex-injected mice as described previously [41]. PPD lightly stains the myelin sheath of all healthy axons while the axoplasm of damaged or dying axons is darkly stained. In brief, the optic nerve was separated from the eyeball and fixed overnight in a phosphate-buffered 3% glutaraldehyde/paraformaldehyde mixture at 4\\u2009\\u00b0C. Following overnight treatment in 1% osmium tetroxide at 4\\u2009\\u00b0C, optic nerves were rinsed in 0.1\\u2009M phosphate buffer and 0.1\\u2009M sodium-acetate buffer, then dehydrated in graded ethanol concentrations. After embedding optic nerves in resin (Eponate-12; Ted Pella), 1\\u2009\\u03bcm sections were cut and stained in 1% PPD for 10\\u2009min. Optic nerve axons were counted manually using a previously described method [41]. In short, 10 non-overlapping images covering the entire optic nerve were taken at 1630x magnification, and axons were counted in the area equal to 10% of the total nerve cross-sectional area. To perform TEM, 1\\u2009\\u03bcm sections were processed for TEM analysis as described previously [39]. To reduce Dex-induced OHT, we utilized commercial IOP lowering eye drops, Cosopt (dorzolamide/timolol 22.3/6.8\\u2009mg; Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America LLC, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) and 0.005% Latanoprost (Alcon Laboratories, Inc. Fort Worth, TX, USA). Mice were injected bilaterally with periocular injections of Veh and Dex and one group of each Veh or Dex mice received either water as a control eye drops (6\\u2009\\u03bcL/eye) and other group received Cosopt (b.i.d) (6\\u2009\\u03bcL/eye) & Latanoprost (once a day at 5\\u2009PM) (6\\u2009\\u03bcL/eye) eye drops throughout the study period starting from the day of injections. Mice were restrained while dosing. IOPs were monitored weekly, and PERG, RGCs labeling and PPD staining of ON was performed after 8\\u2009weeks of injections. To examine the effect of Dex withdrawal on IOP and RGC loss, we discontinued Dex injections in a group of mice as described previously [40]. Briefly, three-month old male C57BL/6\\u2009J mice were injected bilaterally once a week for 5\\u2009weeks with either Veh or Dex. IOPs were monitored weekly to ensure IOP elevation in Dex-injected mice. After 5\\u2009weeks of injections, Dex-injected mice were randomly divided into two groups. Dex treatment was stopped in one group of mice while another group continued to receive Dex for additional 5\\u2009weeks. IOPs were monitored weekly and whole mount retinal staining with RBPMS was performed at the end of 10\\u2009weeks. Previously, we developed a mouse model of OHT by optimizing the formulation of Dex and its administration via periocular injection [40]. In this study, we examined whether Dex treatment leads to sustained IOP elevation that is sufficient to cause glaucomatous neurodegeneration. C57BL/6\\u2009J mice (3\\u2009months-old) were given bilateral periocular injections of either vehicle (Veh) or Dex once a week for 10\\u2009weeks and day and night IOPs were monitored. As shown in Fig.\\u00a01a, Dex led to sustained, pronounced and significant IOP elevation starting from the 1st week of injection. The mean IOP difference between Veh and Dex was ~\\u20094\\u2009mmHg during the daytime (Fig. 1a) and\\u2009~\\u20097\\u2009mmHg during the night-time (SI 1). Outflow facility measurements revealed that Dex significantly (p\\u2009=\\u20090.027) reduced outflow facility by 37.8% after 4\\u2009weeks of injections (0.02\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.009\\u2009\\u03bcL/min/mmHg in Dex vs 0.0322\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.001\\u2009\\u03bcL/min/mmHg in Veh) (Fig. 1b). Importantly, Dex treatment did not alter body weight and both Veh and Dex-treated mice continued to gain weight at similar rates (SI 2). Immunostaining for the major ECM proteins on iridocorneal angles of 10-week Veh and Dex-injected mice clearly showed increased ECM proteins and increased alpha smooth muscle actin expression in TM tissues of Dex-injected mice compared to Veh-injected mice (Fig. 1c, SI 3). Slit-lamp images and H&E staining of 10-week Veh and Dex-injected eyes further confirmed the absence of any ocular abnormalities, and iridocorneal angles were open in both mice groups (SI 4). Together, these data indicate that weekly injections of Dex lead to sustained IOP elevation, reduced AH outflow facility, and glaucomatous TM damage similar to human POAG.\\nFig. 1Periocular administration of Dex leads to elevated IOP, reduced aqueous humor outflow facility and increased ECM deposition in mouse TM tissue. a C57BL/6\\u2009J mice were periocularly injected with either Veh or Dex in both eyes once a week for 10\\u2009weeks, and IOPs were monitored weekly. Dex injections lead to sustained and significant IOP elevation.

A significant reduction (~\\u200937.8%) in outflow facility was observed in 4\\u2009weeks post Dex-injected mice compared to Veh-injected mice (n\\u2009=\\u20098 in each group, unpaired t-test, two tailed, mean\\u2009\\u00b1\\u2009SD, *p\\u2009=\\u20090.027). c Anterior segment tissues after 10\\u2009weeks of Veh (left panel) and Dex (right panel) injected mice were immunostained with ECM markers including fibronectin (FN), collagen I (ColI) and laminin along with \\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA) or phalloidin. Iridocorneal angles are represented by a rectangle white box in each representative image.

Increased deposition of ECM proteins and actin was observed in TM tissues of Dex-injected eyes compared to Veh-injected eyes (n\\u2009=\\u20094 or 6; TM, trabecular meshwork; CB, ciliary body) To examine functional loss of RGCs, we measured pattern electroretinogram (PERG) amplitudes and latencies in 10-week Veh and Dex-injected mice. As shown in Fig.\\u00a02a-d, Dex-injected mice showed a significant (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) reduction in PERG amplitudes (13.81\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20094.86\\u2009\\u03bcV in Dex vs 22.42\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20094.84\\u2009\\u03bcV in Veh) and significantly delayed latency periods (93.86\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200911.45\\u2009ms in Dex vs 81.72\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20092.6\\u2009ms in Veh). Next, we examined whether Dex-induced OHT leads to RGC loss by whole mount retina staining with RGC specific marker, RBPMS. Total numbers of RGCs were analyzed from the whole mount retina in a masked and automated manner using Image J software in 10-week Veh and Dex-injected mice. Dex-injected mice showed significant RGC loss compared to Veh-injected mice (Fig. 2e&f). Overall, there was a\\u2009~\\u200933% RGC loss in Dex-injected mice compared to Veh-injected mice (Fig. 2f). Furthermore, H&E staining on cross sections of retinas demonstrated no gross morphological differences in retinal layers other than cell loss and thinning in the RGC layer in 10-week Veh and Dex-injected mice (SI 5). These data indicate that Dex-induced OHT leads to both structural and functional loss of RGCs.\\nFig. 2Dex-induced OHT leads to functional and structural loss of RGCs in mice. C57BL/6\\u2009J mice were periocularly injected with Veh or Dex for 10\\u2009weeks and RGC functional loss was examined by PERG. Representative wave graphs are shown for Veh (a) and Dex (b) injected mice. PERG amplitude (c) and latency (d) demonstrated a significant functional loss of RGCs in Dex-injected mice as evident from reduced amplitudes with increased latencies.

Therefore, we examined whether Dex-induced OHT causes optic nerve degeneration in mice using p-phenylenediamine (PPD) staining of optic nerves cross sections obtained from 10-week Veh or Dex-injected mice (Fig.\\u00a03a and SI 6). Dex-injected mice demonstrated significant and pronounced optic nerve degeneration as evident from darkly stained axons, presence of vacuoles (SI 7A), active gliosis and glial scar formation. Overall, 62% RGC axonal loss (p\\u2009=\\u20090.0004) was observed in 10-week Dex-injected mice (20,681\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20097146) compared to Veh-injected mice (55,427\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20099037) (Fig. 3b). We further determined ultra-structural changes associated with axonal degeneration using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 3c). Severe demyelination of optic nerve axons and extensive glial scar formation was observed in 10-week Dex-injected mice compared to Veh-injected mice. Dex-induced axonal lesions included hypo-myelinated and naked axons without any myelin sheath, axonal swelling, many residual empty vacuoles (SI 7A), increased mitochondrial accumulation per axon (SI 7B&C) and infiltration of mononuclear immune cells (i.e. macrophage-like cells) in the glial scar region.\\nFig. 3Dex-induced OHT leads to optic nerve axonal degeneration in mice. Optic nerves from 10-week Veh or Dex-injected mice were subjected to PPD staining (a & b) and TEM imaging (C) to examine optic nerve degeneration. a Representative images of PPD stained optic nerves show severe axonal degeneration along with gliosis and glial scar in 10\\u2009weeks Dex-injected mice compared to Veh-injected mice. b The mean axon counts in 10\\u2009weeks Dex-injected mice show a significant reduction in number of healthy axons compared to Veh-injected mice.

In addition, we observed unmyelinated axons, vacuoles, infiltrating immune cells that were associated with optic nerve degeneration in Dex-injected mice compared to Veh-injected mice (n\\u2009=\\u20094).

(* unmyelinated axons; # glial scar; \\u2021 vacuoles; M\\u03c6 infiltrating immune cells) We next determined whether glaucoma phenotypes observed in our model are truly IOP dependent or independent (i.e. any direct deleterious effects of Dex on RGCs). To address this, we reduced IOP in Dex-injected mice throughout the study period (starting from 1st day of injection till 8\\u2009weeks) by applying topical ocular eye drops of Cosopt (b.i.d) and Latanoprost (once daily) and compared glaucoma phenotypes with Veh and Dex-injected mice groups receiving control (water) eye drops. As shown in Fig.\\u00a04a, DexControl mice showed significant and sustained IOP elevation, whereas IOP in DexCosopt\\u2009+\\u2009Latanoprost mice was reduced significantly starting from 1st week of injection. DexControl mice demonstrated prominent reduction in PERG amplitudes (14\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20096.4\\u2009\\u03bcV), whereas DexCosopt\\u2009+\\u2009Latanoprost mice exhibited normal PERG amplitudes similar to VehControl mice (24.3\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20097.1\\u2009\\u03bcV in DexCosopt\\u2009+\\u2009Latanoprost vs 25.8\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20094.4\\u2009\\u03bcV in VehControl) (Fig. 4b). Consistent with PERG, whole-mount retina staining of RBPMS revealed significant loss of RGCs (38% loss) only in DexControl mice (but not in DexCosopt\\u2009+\\u2009Latanoprost mice (Fig. 4c). Also, PPD staining of optic nerves demonstrated significant axonal degeneration in DexControl mice (~\\u200948% loss) compared to VehControl mice, while axonal degeneration was prevented completely in DexCosopt\\u2009+\\u2009Latanoprost mice (Fig. 4d). In addition, infiltrated immune cells were observed in the degenerated optic nerves of DexControl mice, while reduction of IOP prevented immune cells infiltration in the optic nerves of DexCosopt\\u2009+\\u2009Latanoprost mice similar to VehControl mice (SI\\n8). These data clearly indicate that reduction of IOP prevents Dex-induced glaucomatous neurodegeneration.\\nFig. 4Dex-induced glaucomatous neurodegeneration is IOP dependent. Three-month old C57BL/6\\u2009J mice were injected bilaterally once a week for 8\\u2009weeks with either Veh or Dex, and given topical ocular eye drops of either control (water) or Cosopt (b.i.d)\\u2009+\\u2009Latanoprost (once a day) for 8\\u2009weeks. a Dex injected mice receiving control eye drops (DexControl) show sustained and significant IOP elevation compared to Veh injected mice receiving control eye drops (VehControl), IOP is significantly reduced in Dex-injected mice receiving Cosopt+Latanoprost eye drops (DexCosopt\\u2009+\\u2009Latanoprost) compared to DexControl mice.

Three-month old C57BL/6\\u2009J mice were injected with either Veh or Dex via periocular injections once a week for 5\\u2009weeks. IOPs were monitored and IOP elevation in Dex-injected mice was ensured. After 5\\u2009weeks of injections, Dex-treated mice were randomly divided into two groups. Dex-treatment was discontinued in one group while other group continued to receive Dex for an\\u00a0additional 5\\u2009weeks. As shown in Fig.\\u00a05a, Dex induced IOP returned to baseline within a week upon withdrawal of Dex and no significant difference was observed in terms of IOP between Veh and Dex discontinued group of mice after withdrawal. However, mice that received Dex continuously for 10\\u2009weeks demonstrated sustained and significant IOP elevation. Mice that received Dex continuously for 10\\u2009weeks showed significant RGC loss compared to 10-week Veh injected mice (Fig. 5b). Overall, there was a\\u2009~\\u200934% RGC loss in 10-week Dex-injected mice compared to Veh-injected mice. However, Dex discontinued group of mice did not show RGC loss despite initial IOP elevation for 5\\u2009weeks (Fig. 5b&c) and the total number of RGCs remained similar between 10-week Veh injected and Dex discontinued mice (Fig. 5c). This data further indicated that Dex-induced RGC loss is IOP dependent and reduction of IOP by the withdrawal of Dex during the initial stages of disease onset can halt progression of glaucomatous neurodegeneration.\\nFig. 5Withdrawal of Dex results in IOP reduction and prevents Dex-induced RGC loss. Three-month old C57BL/6\\u2009J mice were injected bilaterally once a week for 5-weeks with either Veh or Dex. Dex-treated mice were randomly divided in two groups.

Three-month old C57BL/6\\u2009J mice were injected bilaterally once a week for 5-weeks with either Veh or Dex. Dex-treated mice were randomly divided in two groups. Dex treatment was withdrawn in one group while another group continued to receive Dex for additional 5\\u2009weeks. a Weekly IOP measurements revealed sustained and significant IOP elevation in Dex-injected mice compared to Veh-injected mice. Withdrawal of Dex injections caused significant reduction of elevated IOP in Dex discontinued group.

We therefore determined whether Dex-induced glaucomatous neurodegeneration is associated with astrocyte activation. Optic nerves and retinas from 10-week Veh or Dex-injected mice were stained with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody. A strong GFAP staining was observed in the ONH of Dex-injected mice compared to Veh-injected mice (Fig.\\u00a06a,\\nSI 9A). In addition, we observed relatively higher GFAP in the inner retina of Dex-injected mice (Fig. 6b). Similar to these findings, a prominent GFAP staining was observed in the ONH of human glaucomatous optic nerve compared to age-matched normal optic nerves (Fig. 6c,\\nSI 9B). These data clearly indicate that Dex-induced glaucomatous neurodegeneration is associated with reactive astrocytes, similar to human glaucoma.\\nFig. 6Sustained Dex-induced IOP elevation causes robust activation of astrocytes in ONH, ON and retina. Longitudinal sections of optic nerves (a) and whole mount retinas (b) were collected from 10\\u2009weeks post Veh or Dex-injected mice, and immunostained for reactive astrocytes with GFAP (green). a Hypertrophic reactive astrocytes with increased expression of GFAP were observed in ONH cross sections in 10\\u2009weeks Dex-injected mice (n\\u2009=\\u20095) compared to Veh-injected mice (n\\u2009=\\u20093). b Immunostaining of whole mount retinas with GFAP (green) and RBPMS (red) show relatively higher number reactive astrocytes and decreased RGCs in 10\\u2009weeks Dex-injected mice compared to Veh-injected mice (n\\u2009=\\u20098). c For comparisons, longitudinal sections of aged-matched human normal and glaucomatous optic nerves were immunostained with antibodies specific for GFAP and neurofilament-heavy chain (NF-H) (red). Loss of NF-H with increased GFAP expressing reactive astrocytes are observed throughout the length of human glaucomatous optic nerve compared to aged-matched normal human optic nerve. In addition, there is a robust activation of astrocytes in human glaucomatous ONH (n\\u2009=\\u20095) compared to normal ONH (n\\u2009=\\u20094) Sustained Dex-induced IOP elevation causes robust activation of astrocytes in ONH, ON and retina. Longitudinal sections of optic nerves (a) and whole mount retinas (b) were collected from 10\\u2009weeks post Veh or Dex-injected mice, and immunostained for reactive astrocytes with GFAP (green). a Hypertrophic reactive astrocytes with increased expression of GFAP were observed in ONH cross sections in 10\\u2009weeks Dex-injected mice (n\\u2009=\\u20095) compared to Veh-injected mice (n\\u2009=\\u20093). b Immunostaining of whole mount retinas with GFAP (green) and RBPMS (red) show relatively higher number reactive astrocytes and decreased RGCs in 10\\u2009weeks Dex-injected mice compared to Veh-injected mice (n\\u2009=\\u20098). c For comparisons, longitudinal sections of aged-matched human normal and glaucomatous optic nerves were immunostained with antibodies specific for GFAP and neurofilament-heavy chain (NF-H) (red). Loss of NF-H with increased GFAP expressing reactive astrocytes are observed throughout the length of human glaucomatous optic nerve compared to aged-matched normal human optic nerve. In addition, there is a robust activation of astrocytes in human glaucomatous ONH (n\\u2009=\\u20095) compared to normal ONH (n\\u2009=\\u20094) Anterograde transport blockage at the ONH is associated with glaucomatous neurodegeneration [53, 54]. We therefore investigated whether the axonal transport deficits are associated with Dex-induced neurodegeneration using fluorescently tagged cholera toxin (CT) B dye. C57BL/6\\u2009J mice were injected with Veh or Dex for 10\\u2009weeks, and CTB was injected intravitreally. 48\\u2009h after injections, CTB transport was examined in the retina and ONH (Fig.\\u00a07). Veh-injected mice demonstrated a continuous and uninterrupted transport of CTB along the entire length of optic nerve. However, in Dex-injected mice, most of CTB accumulated in the proximal region of ONH and no dye was transported to the distal region of optic nerve (Fig. 7). These results indicate that Dex-induced OHT leads to blockage of anterograde axonal transport at the ONH.\\nFig. 7Dex-induced OHT leads to axonal transport deficits in mice. C57BL/6\\u2009J mice treated with Veh and Dex for 10\\u2009weeks and injected intravitreally with red fluorescently tagged CTB dye (Alexa fluor 555). The proximal (close to ONH) and distal (close to optic chiasm) regions of optic nerve are marked in DIC image of optic nerve on the upper panel. Veh-injected mice showed an uninterrupted axoplasmic anterograde transportation of CTB along the entire length of optic nerve including both proximal and distal regions. However, CTB transport was blocked completely at ONH and no CTB was detected in distal region of optic nerve (n\\u2009=\\u20094) Dex-induced OHT leads to axonal transport deficits in mice. C57BL/6\\u2009J mice treated with Veh and Dex for 10\\u2009weeks and injected intravitreally with red fluorescently tagged CTB dye (Alexa fluor 555). The proximal (close to ONH) and distal (close to optic chiasm) regions of optic nerve are marked in DIC image of optic nerve on the upper panel. Veh-injected mice showed an uninterrupted axoplasmic anterograde transportation of CTB along the entire length of optic nerve including both proximal and distal regions. However, CTB transport was blocked completely at ONH and no CTB was detected in distal region of optic nerve (n\\u2009=\\u20094) TEM analysis of optic nerve cross sections from Dex-injected mice revealed the presence of infiltrating immune cells associated with optic nerve degeneration (Fig. 3c). Therefore, we confirmed the nature of infiltrating immune cells by F4/80 antibody staining on sections of optic nerves from 10-week Veh and Dex-injected mice (Fig.\\u00a08a&b). Numerous infiltrating F4/80+ activated macrophage-like cells were observed in the ONH of Dex-injected mice. We further examined whether similar F4/80+ activated macrophage-like cells are also present in ONH tissues from human POAG donors. Age-matched normal (n\\u2009=\\u20094) and glaucomatous (n\\u2009=\\u20094) ONH sections were stained with antibodies for F4/80 and TNF-\\u03b1. Striking infiltration of F4/80+ activated macrophage-like cells producing proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\\u03b1 were observed in human glaucomatous ONH compared to age-matched normal donor tissues (Fig. 8c&d). These data indicate that Dex-induced axonal degeneration is associated with infiltrating immune cells similar to human POAG.\\nFig. 8Glaucomatous neurodegeneration is associated with activation of F4/80 positive macrophage-like cells. a&b 10\\u2009weeks Veh and Dex-injected eyes are enucleated, sectioned through ONH and analyzed for F4/80 positive cells by immunostaining. The corresponding images from 10\\u2009weeks post Dex-injected eyes showed an increased number of F4/80 positive macrophage-like cells at ONH compared to 10\\u2009weeks Veh injected eyes (n\\u2009=\\u20094). c&d For comparisons, a similar trend is observed in the human glaucomatous ONH, where the number of F4/80 positive macrophage-like cells expressing TNF-\\u03b1 (green) is significantly higher in glaucomatous ONH compared to age matched normal ONH (n\\u2009=\\u20094 in normal and n\\u2009=\\u20094 in glaucoma). Data are shown as mean\\u2009\\u00b1\\u2009SD (unpaired t-test, two tailed, **p\\u2009=\\u20090.002, ***p\\u2009=\\u20090.0007) Glaucomatous neurodegeneration is associated with activation of F4/80 positive macrophage-like cells. a&b 10\\u2009weeks Veh and Dex-injected eyes are enucleated, sectioned through ONH and analyzed for F4/80 positive cells by immunostaining.

Since we observed RGC cell death and optic nerve degeneration at 8 and 10\\u2009weeks of Dex treatment, we evaluated glaucomatous neurodegeneration at an early time period of Dex treatment (5\\u2009weeks). We observed no significant differences in PERG amplitudes (22.07\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20093.95uV in Veh and 19.59\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20095.45uV in Dex) or latency periods (88.11\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20094.75\\u2009msec in Veh and 84.27\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20098.1\\u2009msec in Dex) in 5-week Veh or Dex-injected mice (Fig.\\u00a09a&b and SI 10). Consistent with these data, we also observed no significant loss of RGCs in 5-week Veh or Dex-injected mice (Fig. 9c). Enumerating RGCs from whole mount retina revealed that the total number of surviving RGCs were similar in both Veh and Dex-injected mice (Fig. 9d). These data established that Dex-induced OHT for 5\\u2009weeks does not lead to functional or structural loss of RGCs soma. Next, we examined axonal degeneration of optic nerves after 5\\u2009weeks of Dex treatment. Previous studies have suggested that axonal degeneration can be compartmentalized and both dying back and Wallerian degeneration were proposed as mechanisms of distal axonal degeneration in mouse models of glaucoma [55, 56]. We therefore examined the axonal degeneration pattern in our model at both proximal (close to ONH) and distal (close to optic chiasm) regions of optic nerves by TEM analysis and PPD staining. Despite no RGC loss, TEM imaging showed significant axonal degeneration in 5-week Dex-injected mice as evident from loss of healthy myelinated axons as well as the presence of astrocyte processes at the proximal region of optic nerves (Fig. 9e). However, no axonal injury was evident at the distal region of optic nerves in 5-week Dex-treated mice. Also, the morphology of axons at distal region of optic nerves of Dex-injected mice was undistinguishable from Veh-injected mice (Fig. 9f). Immunostaining data further revealed that the proximal axonal injury in 5\\u2009weeks Dex-injected mice was associated with significant increase in reactivation of astrocytes and moderate increase in immune cell infiltration at ONH (SI 11). Since we observed axonal injury at the proximal region of Dex-injected optic nerves, we further quantified healthy myelinated axons using PPD staining. Approximately 32% loss of optic nerve axon was observed in 5-week Dex-injected mice compared to Veh-injected mice (Fig. 9g). Contrary to this, PPD staining on 10-week Dex-injected optic nerves showed similar degenerative patterns at both proximal and distal ends of optic nerves (SI 12). These data indicate that Dex-induced OHT initiates axonal degeneration at the proximal region of optic nerves. Moreover, Dex-induced optic nerve degeneration precedes structural and functional loss of RGC soma.\\nFig. 9Optic nerve degeneration precedes structural and functional loss of RGCs. Three-month old C57BL/6\\u2009J mice were injected bilaterally once a week for 5\\u2009weeks with Veh or Dex. The structural and functional loss of RGCs was analyzed by PERG and immunostaining (a-d). Optic nerve degeneration was examined via TEM and PPD staining (e-g).

In consistence with PERG data, the flat mount retinal images stained with RBPMS (c) and the corresponding dot plots (d) showed no significant RGC loss between the 5\\u2009weeks post Veh and Dex injected mice (n\\u2009=\\u20099 in Veh and n\\u2009=\\u20097 in Dex). The data are shown as mean\\u2009\\u00b1\\u2009SD (unpaired t-test, two tailed, ns\\u2009=\\u2009not statistically significant, p\\u2009>\\u20090.05).

C57BL/6\\u2009J mice were periocularly injected with Veh in one eye while the contralateral eye was injected with Dex for 5 or 8\\u2009weeks and IOPs were monitored weekly to ensure OHT. To analyze axonal anterograde transport, Veh-injected eyes were intravitreally injected with red fluorescently tagged CTB dye while the contralateral Dex-injected eyes were intravitreally injected with green fluorescently tagged CTB dye at 5 and 8\\u2009weeks (Fig.\\u00a010 a-d). 48-h after injections, anterograde transport of CTB was tracked through the entire optic nerve as well as visual centers of brain including the superior colliculus (SC). Gross examination of CTB at 5\\u2009weeks of treatment revealed similar levels of CTB transport along the entire optic nerve and into the SC in both Veh and Dex-injected eyes (Fig.\\u00a010a). However, axonal transport of CTB was completely blocked at the ONH in 8-week Dex-injected eyes compared to Veh-injected contralateral eyes (Fig.\\u00a010b). Consistent with this, no CTB transport was detected at the SC in 8\\u2009weeks Dex-treated eyes. We further examined CTB transport to the visual centers using serial sections of the SC at 5 (Fig.\\u00a010c) and 8 (Fig.\\u00a010d) weeks of treatment. When we analyzed CTB transport in entire SC using serial frontal sections, we observed mild transport deficiency in posterior regions of SC after 5\\u2009weeks of Dex treatment (Fig.\\u00a010c). In addition, no CTB was detected in any SC layers after 8\\u2009weeks of Dex treatment (Fig.\\u00a010c). These data indicate that majority of anterograde transport persists to visual centers during initial stages of axonal degeneration and the degree of anterograde transport deficits are dependent on severity of axonal degeneration.\\nFig. 10Anterograde transport persists during initial stages of optic nerve degeneration. Three-month old C57BL/6\\u2009J mice were injected unilaterally with Veh and Dex once a week for 5 or 8\\u2009weeks and axonal anterograde transport deficits were tracked through entire visual pathway including optic nerve and superior colliculus (SC) using fluorescently tagged CTB. CTB Alexa Fluor 555 (Red) and CTB Alexa Fluor 488 (Green) were used to tract transport deficits in Veh and Dex-injected eyes respectively. a Representative DIC images connecting eyes to the brain from 5\\u2009weeks injected mice show an active transportation of CTB in both Veh and Dex-injected eyes. b Representative DIC images show accumulation of CTB (green fluorescence) at the ONH in 8\\u2009weeks Dex-injected eyes compared to contralateral Veh-injected eyes (CTB-red fluorescence). c Serial frontal sections of brain confirm a loss of axonal transport of CTB with mild deficits in the posterior SC regions in 5\\u2009weeks Dex-injected eyes compared to contralateral Veh-injected eyes (n\\u2009=\\u20095). d Serial frontal sections of brain confirm the axonal transport deficits of CTB in SC regions corresponding to 8\\u2009weeks Dex-injected eyes compared to contralateral Veh injected eyes indicating complete axonal anterograde transport deficits during later stages of axonal damage (n\\u2009=\\u20095) Anterograde transport persists during initial stages of optic nerve degeneration.

As shown in Fig. 10a, gross analysis of CTB transport appears to be normal in both Veh and Dex-treated eyes. We further performed serial cross sections at proximal, center and distal regions of optic nerve at 5\\u2009weeks treatment (Fig.\\u00a011a), and fluorescent intensities were analyzed and measured in different regions (Fig.\\u00a011b&c). While most of the CTB (red fluorescence) was transported uniformly throughout optic nerves in Veh-treated eyes, higher fluorescent intensities of CTB (green fluorescence) were observed near the proximal regions compared to distal regions of optic nerves in Dex-injected eyes. We observed a 25% reduction in fluorescent intensities of CTB from proximal to distal ends of the optic nerve in Veh-injected eyes whereas ~\\u200950% reduction was observed in Dex-injected eyes (Fig.\\u00a011c). These data indicate that there is a partial blockage of CTB transport in Dex-treated optic nerve progressing from proximal to distal. These data further suggest that partial axonal transport deficits observed in SC region of Dex-treated mice are likely due to blockage of transport at the ONH.\\nFig. 11Partial axonal transport deficits at the ONH is associated with early stages of optic nerve degeneration in Dex-treated mice.

Therefore, several laboratories have attempted to develop mouse models of GC-induced glaucoma using either systemic or topical ocular administration of GCs. However, most of these studies were limited to study GC-induced OHT most likely due to insufficient IOP elevation to cause glaucomatous neurodegeneration. We recently developed a mouse model of GC-induced OHT via periocular injections of Dex, which led to pronounced IOP elevation. However, we did not determine whether Dex-induced IOP elevation was sustained and sufficient to develop glaucomatous neurodegeneration similar to human POAG. In this study, we demonstrate that weekly injections of Dex lead to sustained and pronounced IOP elevation, which is associated with reduced AH outflow and dysfunction of TM similar to POAG. Our studies clearly show that Dex-induced OHT leads to robust and pronounced glaucomatous neurodegeneration, including functional and structural loss of RGCs and optic nerve degeneration. Optic nerve axonal degeneration is also associated with reactive astrocytes, transport deficits and infiltration of macrophage-like cells in the ONH. Using this model, we evaluated early events of glaucomatous neurodegeneration, which is crucial to understand the etiology of glaucoma and to develop novel therapeutic strategies to halt disease progression. Here, we demonstrate that IOP-induced axonal damage occurs at the ONH and rapidly progresses toward the distal ends of the optic nerve. Optic nerve degeneration precedes structural and functional loss of RGCs in response to Dex-induced OHT. By analyzing axonal transport mechanisms at 3 different crucial time points (i.e. 5, 8 and 10\\u2009weeks) of sustained IOP elevation, we present evidence that the majority of active anterograde axonal transport persists during the early stage of optic nerve degeneration (32% axonal loss at 5\\u2009weeks), while complete transport deficits only occur at later stages of axonal damage (more than 50% axonal loss at 8 and 10\\u2009weeks of treatment). Although there are several mouse models to study pathophysiology of glaucomatous neurodegeneration, most of these models do not faithfully replicate human POAG. We have previously developed a transgenic mouse model of myocilin glaucoma and demonstrated that transgenic mice exhibit glaucoma phenotypes similar to myocilin patients [41]. However, glaucomatous neurodegeneration in this model is slow and requires aging of mice. Therefore, there is critical need to develop inducible mouse models of POAG that develop robust glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Our Dex-induced glaucoma mouse model demonstrates striking similarities with human POAG. These features include open iridocorneal angle, IOP elevation caused by reduced outflow facility due to TM dysfunction, and biochemical and morphological changes in the TM similar to POAG. In addition, Dex leads to IOP dependent progressive optic nerve degeneration and loss of RGCs. Specifically, lowering of IOP prevents Dex-induced glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Studies on humans demonstrated that discontinuation of GC therapy normalizes the IOP within 1 to 4\\u2009weeks [26, 57] by restoring the outflow facility and may halt the disease progression. Previous studies from our group also observed withdrawal of Dex lowers down IOP within 1 or 2\\u2009weeks in mouse models of OHT depending on route of administration [40]. Consistent with these studies, we also observed that withdrawal of Dex normalized the IOP within 7 to 10\\u2009days and halted the progression of RGC loss. Together, these studies suggest that Dex-induced glaucoma is truly dependent on IOP. Despite several attempts to develop mouse model of Steroid-induced glaucoma, this is the only mouse model of Steroid-induced ocular hypertension that develops robust and reproducible glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Our Dex-induced glaucoma model offers several advantages and exhibits unique features of glaucomatous neurodegeneration that were not observed previously in other inducible mouse models of glaucoma. First, unlike current models, IOP elevation in our Dex mouse model is largely due to TM dysfunction, and it is associated with reduced outflow facility similar to POAG. Second, Dex-induced glaucomatous neurodegeneration is truly IOP-dependent and demonstrates reproducible phenotypes. More than 90% of eyes treated with Dex develop OHT and glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Third, the exact timeline of glaucomatous neurodegeneration can easily be tracked. IOP elevation starting from the 1st week of injections, optic nerve degeneration can be observed at 5\\u2009weeks of treatment, which is followed by structural and functional loss of RGCs and complete blockage of axonal transport at 8\\u2009weeks (Fig.\\u00a012). These features make our Dex-induced glaucoma model ideal to study pathophysiology of glaucomatous damage to TM tissue, RGC loss, and axonal degeneration. Furthermore, this model can be effectively utilized to screen new treatment strategies targeted to reduce IOP or to develop novel neuroprotective agents.\\nFig. 12The schematic diagram showing the timeline of the progression of glaucomatous neurodegeneration in mouse model of Dex-induced OHT. Dex treatment leads to significant IOP elevation starting from 1\\u2009week of injection, which is associated with reduced outflow facility. These changes are associated with ECM accumulation and increased cytoskeleton proteins in the TM. About 32% ON axonal loss and activation of astrocytes in ONH was observed at 5\\u2009weeks of Dex treatment. At this stage, we did not observe functional or structural loss of RGCs. Most of the CTB transport was active at this stage. At 8 and 10\\u2009weeks of treatment, there was 48 and 62% loss of optic nerve axons respectively. At this stage, significant structural (30\\u201340%) and functional loss of RGCs was observed. We also observed complete blockage of axoplasmic transport along with activation of astrocytes and infiltration of immune cells The schematic diagram showing the timeline of the progression of glaucomatous neurodegeneration in mouse model of Dex-induced OHT.

At this stage, significant structural (30\\u201340%) and functional loss of RGCs was observed. We also observed complete blockage of axoplasmic transport along with activation of astrocytes and infiltration of immune cells GCs are known to have strong anti-inflammatory and immune suppressive properties, and are often used for the treatment of traumatic optic neuropathy and optic neuritis to inhibit inflammation [58]. In our model, it is intriguing to note the presence of reactive astrocytes and F4/80+ immune cells associated with optic nerve degeneration. It is likely that Dex effects are localized to the TM region and there is no direct effect of Dex on the optic nerve and RGCs. Lowering of IOP rescued Dex-induced glaucomatous neurodegeneration further supporting our hypothesis that Dex injected via the periocular route has no direct effect on RGCs or ONH cells. Our study clearly demonstrates that initial insult to neurons occurs in the glial lamina region of the optic nerve similar to that observed in human and primate models of glaucoma [49], and it is accompanied by numerous cellular responses including activation of astrocytes and infiltration of immune cells [50, 59\\u201363]. Also, optic nerve degeneration precedes structural and functional loss of RGCs in our Dex mouse model of glaucoma. Consistent with our findings, some studies using the DBA/2\\u2009J mouse model also reported that axonal dysfunction and degeneration occurs before loss of RGCs [55, 64]. Our experimental data based on TEM imaging from 5- and 10-week post Dex-induced OHT mice further suggest that optic nerve degeneration occurs distal to the RGCs soma initiating at the ONH and rapidly progressing towards the distal region of optic nerve following Wallerian type axonal degeneration. Axonal degeneration is associated with the presence of reactive astrocytes, glial scar and infiltrating macrophage-like cells. Similarly, activated astrocytes were also observed in the ONH of human POAG tissues. Our Dex-model allows the study of key early pathological events of glaucomatous neurodegeneration using different time periods of OHT (5, 8 and 10\\u2009weeks) and we discovered several new mechanistic insights that were not previously described. The pattern of axonal degeneration is quite different than reported in previous studies. These differences include presence of hypomyelinated and naked optic nerve axons with the presence of vacuoles. It is possible that these features of early stages of axonal degeneration are unique to this Dex model. Anterograde axonal transport deficits have been shown to precede retrograde transport deficits [65] and studies by Crish et al. 2010 demonstrated that distal transport deficits at SC are prodegenerative in DBA/2\\u2009J mice [56]. However, it is not completely understood whether anterograde axonal transport deficits precede or proceed optic nerve degeneration or loss of RGCs in mouse models of POAG. Utilizing precise timeframes of neurodegeneration, our studies clearly demonstrate that most axonal transport persists through the optic nerve to visual centers of the brain despite initial optic nerve degeneration (~\\u200932% loss of axons at 5\\u2009weeks). A complete blockage of axonal transport was only observed in optic nerve after 8\\u2009weeks of OHT (~\\u200948% loss of axons). Although gross analysis did not reveal any discernable changes in the transport of CTB to the SC at 5\\u2009weeks of OHT, it is interesting to note a partial block of transport of CTB in posterior layers of SC when serial sectioning of the SC was performed. In contrast, a complete blockage of CTB was observed at the ONH and no CTB was transported into the SC in 8-week Dex-treated mice. CTB transport deficits to the SC at 5\\u2009weeks of Dex treatment could be due to degenerative processes in the SC or ONH. To further clarify this, we performed serial cross sections of optic nerves, which revealed that partial transport deficits in the ONH of 5\\u2009weeks Dex-treated eyes. Although there was relative loss of transport at 5\\u2009weeks, the fact that most of the CTB was transported to the SC suggests that the majority of anterograde transport is active during initial stages of optic nerve degeneration. These data also indicate that optic nerve degeneration and anterograde transport deficits precede RGC soma loss. The presence of most of active axonal transport despite axonal injury in 5-week Dex-injected mice suggests existence of intact axonal cytoskeletal machinery or transport compensation through the rest of healthy axons at initial stages of degeneration. Since axonal transport is a cell survival process, the functional integrity of active axonal transport in 5-week Dex-injected mice may support RGCs soma survival, which can explain no structural or functional loss of RGC soma at this stage. This also opens up a potential window for regeneration strategies to support dying axons along with effective reduction of IOP to prevent further neurodegeneration. Our mouse model provides well-defined molecular events that lead from IOP elevation to axonal degeneration. Contrary to the studies in DBA/2\\u2009J, which proposed both dying back and Wallerian degeneration as mechanisms of axon degeneration [55, 56], axonal degeneration in our mouse model closely resembles a Wallerian degeneration-like pattern. This is evident from focally swollen and damaged axons as well as the presence of vacuoles. When we examined optic nerve in the proximal versus distal regions of the ONH of the same eye, we observed degeneration only in proximal optic nerve at initial stages of neurodegeneration (5-weeks). However, optic nerve degeneration was observed in both proximal and distal regions of optic nerve at a later stage of degeneration (10\\u2009weeks), further supporting that degeneration initiates at the ONH region and progresses toward the distal end of optic nerve at later stages of degeneration. Also, we observed increased accumulation of mitochondria in this mouse model indicating axonal vulnerability to mitochondrial dysfunction or altered mitochondrial biogenesis, which may further affect neuronal functions including energy demands, metabolic balance, apoptotic signaling and intracellular calcium homeostasis. Axonal cytoskeletal distortion and mitochondrial dysfunction further leads to complete deficits in axonal transportation. In addition, hypomyelinated and naked axons with severe demyelination are observed in our mouse model, which may halt the neurotransmission of action potentials. Importantly, we noted reactive astrocytes and infiltrating F4/80+ activated macrophage-like cells during the axonal degeneration process in both human glaucoma and in our mouse model of glaucoma. Similar to our findings, monocyte infiltration into the ONH and its role in RGC damage has been reported in DBA/2\\u2009J model [62, 63]. Reactive astrocytes and F4/80+ activated macrophage-like cells observed in our mouse model are detrimental for axonal regeneration as they modulate complement activation, endothelin signaling and secretory proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\\u03b1 [62, 66]. As a consequence of severe axonal degeneration, we observed significant RGC loss with reduced PERG amplitudes with increased latency periods in our mouse model. The structural integrity of the remaining retinal layers are not affected by the IOP induced damage. In our mouse model, the estimated loss of RGCs (33%) is milder when compared to axonal loss (62%). Although these data suggest that RGC axonal loss precedes structural and functional loss of soma, it is possible that there are significant changes in dendritic structures in certain types of RGCs. Previous studies have clearly shown significant dendritic changes in the RGCs after a brief exposure of OHT [67, 68]. Since we did not detect any significant reduction of PERG at 5-weeks of treatment, it is possible that these dendritic changes have minimum effect on RGC function. Also, the observed loss of RGCs in retinal whole mount of our mouse model is not uniform where the loss of RGCs is most severe in the periphery compared to mid-periphery and center. In this study, we observed the loss of RGCs is restricted to two quadrants in a few of whole mount retinas from Dex-injected mice. A similar RGC loss pattern is reported by Jakobs et al., using the DBA/2\\u2009J mouse model of inherited chronic glaucoma [69]. A previous study by Zode et al., reported 16% of RGC loss after 20-weeks of daily administration of topical eye drops of Dex [38]. However, ~\\u200933% loss of RGCs was observed at 10\\u2009weeks of Dex-treatment in our current model. RGC loss was analyzed at 3 different time periods. We observed no loss of RGCs at 5\\u2009weeks, 38% loss of RGCs at 8\\u2009weeks (eye drop group), and 33% loss of RGCs at 10\\u2009weeks of Dex treatment. RGC loss at 8-weeks of Dex treatment was higher than 10\\u2009weeks. This is likely due chronic handling of mice for daily eye drops and low sample size. We also observed less weight gain in mice treated with eye drops compared untreated mice. Nonetheless, it is possible that Dex-induced RGC loss is variable in this model. It is interesting to note that Dex-induced optic nerve degeneration consistently declined with time period of treatment. We observed about 32% loss of axons at 5\\u2009weeks, 48% loss at 8\\u2009weeks and 62% loss at 10\\u2009weeks of Dex treatment (Fig.\\u00a012). We developed a simple and highly reproducible mouse model of glaucoma that faithfully mimics human glaucoma including IOP elevation induced by TM dysfunction and reduction of AH outflow, IOP-dependent glaucomatous neurodegeneration, axonal degeneration associated with robust activation of astrocytes, demyelination and immune cell infiltration and RGC loss. Utilizing this model, we define molecular events of glaucomatous neurodegeneration that occur as a result of chronic IOP elevation. Strikingly, we show that optic nerve degeneration preceded RGC structural and functional loss. Also, axonal transport mechanisms persist during initial stages of optic nerve degeneration. These findings provide a potential therapeutic window to target early changes of axonal degeneration for the treatment of glaucoma. Additional file 1: Fig. S1.

This recharacterized Schwann cell guides newly regrowing axons to their destination and remyelinates reinnervated axons. This Schwann cell dynamics during Wallerian degeneration is associated with oxidative events. Heme oxygenases (HOs) are involved in the oxidative degradation of heme into biliverdin/bilirubin, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide. Overproduction of ferrous iron by HOs increases reactive oxygen species, which have deleterious effects on living cells. Thus, the key molecule for understanding the exact mechanism of Wallerian degeneration in the peripheral nervous system is likely related to oxidative stress-mediated HOs in Schwann cells. In this study, we demonstrate that demyelinating Schwann cells during Wallerian degeneration highly express HO1, not HO2, and remyelinating Schwann cells during nerve regeneration decrease HO1 activation to levels similar to those in normal myelinating Schwann cells. In addition, HO1 activation during Wallerian degeneration regulates several critical phenotypes of recharacterized repair Schwann cells, such as demyelination, transdedifferentiation, and proliferation. Thus, these results suggest that oxidative stress in Schwann cells after peripheral nerve injury may be regulated by HO1 activation during Wallerian degeneration and oxidative-stress-related HO1 activation in Schwann cells may be helpful to study deeply molecular mechanism of Wallerian degeneration.\\n\\nFull Text: After peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells play unique roles in peripheral nerves. Denervating signals induce intracellular events in mature Schwann cells and the myelin sheath in Schwann cells is then broken down molecularly and mechanically by recruited macrophages and the Schwann cells themselves. Besides myelin fragmentation, at the distal part of the peripheral nerve after injury, axonal degradation occurs directly by the axons themselves (Fischer et\\u00a0al., 2012; Bros et\\u00a0al., 2014)) and indirectly by Schwann cells (Jung et\\u00a0al., 2011a). These phenomena are known as Wallerian degeneration. Efficient Wallerian degeneration leads to efficient peripheral nerve regeneration. However, once in a while, under acute abnormal conditions, such as mechanical injury of peripheral nerves, the nerve degeneration becomes inefficient and the degenerated peripheral nerve is not recovered or regenerated. One of the causes of entry into a neurodegenerative state is oxidative stress (D\\u2019Aguanno et\\u00a0al., 2010; Caillaud et\\u00a0al., 2018). Heme oxygenases (HOs) consist of two isoforms, HO1 (heat-shock protein 32) and HO2, which catalyze the oxidation of cellular heme into biliverdin, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide (CO) in mammalian cells. HOs are well studied in the central nervous system. In normal brain, HO2 is widely and abundantly distributed in neuronal and nonneuronal cells throughout the brain and spinal cord (Verma et\\u00a0al., 1993; Dwyer et\\u00a0al., 1995). In contrast, HO1 is not expressed in normal, unstressed brain, but is highly expressed in stressed brain (Maines, 1997; Platt and Nath, 1998). For example, HO1 is highly expressed in glial cells in brain neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\\u2019s disease and Parkinson\\u2019s disease (Schipper et\\u00a0al., 1995, 1998). In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), HO1 is highly expressed in Schwann cells of sciatic nerves after nerve injury (Hirata et\\u00a0al., 2000; Yama et\\u00a0al., 2016). These studies imply that HO1 activation is related to oxidative stress-mediated nerve degeneration; however, the authors did not determine, in detail, the oxidative stress-mediated molecular, functional, or morphological mechanisms by which Schwann cells via HO1 activation guide Wallerian degeneration and nerve regeneration in injured Schwann cells. Here, using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo peripheral neurodegenerative models, we show the HO1 activation pattern in Schwann cells during peripheral nerve degeneration and regeneration and demonstrate that regulation of HO1 in Schwann cells affects critical events in Wallerian degeneration such as demyelination, and Schwann cell transdedifferentiation and proliferation. Our results indicate that the regulation of HO1 activation in Schwann cells likely protects against oxidative stress-induced neural damage and that HO1 represents an effective therapeutic target for peripheral nerve degenerative diseases. Adult male Sprague-Dawely rats (RRID:RGD_7246927; 200 g, Samtako, Osan, Korea) were used for all in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments. All experiments were conducted according to protocols approved by the Kyung Hee University Committee on Animal Research, KHUASP(SE)-16-043-1, following the guidelines of animal experimentation established by the Korean Academy of Medical Sciences. All antibodies were commercially purchased and used for immunochemistry or Western blotting. Antibodies against HO1 (RRID:AB_10618757) and HO2 (RRID:AB_11180908) were from Enzo Life Sciences Inc. (Farmigdale, NY, USA). Antibodies against myelin basic protein (MBP, RRID:AB_92396), lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1, RRID:AB_2134495), p75 nerve growth factor receptor (p75, RRID:AB_2267254), and nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1, RRID:AB_2152494) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Anti-Ki67 (RRID:AB_302459) was from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Neurofilament (NF, RRID:AB_94275) and Alexa Fluor 488- and 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (488-, RRID:AB_141607; 594-, RRID:AB_2534105, 141637, 2535795) were from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY, USA). Nrg1 (human NRG1-\\u03b21 extracellular domain) and forskolin were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) and Calbiochem (Gibbstown, NJ, USA), respectively. All of the other antibodies (\\u03b2-actin, RRID:AB_476744; S100\\u03b2, RRID:AB_477499) and HO-inhibitory drugs were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Ex vivo sciatic nerve explant cultures were conducted as previously described (Park et\\u00a0al., 2015). Briefly, the sciatic nerves are extracted and connective tissues around the sciatic nerves were removed under a stereomicroscope. The extracted sciatic nerves were divided into 3 to 4 mm small size pieces in length. For sciatic nerve explant culture, the nerve pieces were incubated in Dulbecco\\u2019s Modified Eagle\\u2019s Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine (4\\u2009mM), penicillin (100\\u2009U/mL), and streptomycin (100\\u2009\\u03bcg/mL) at 37\\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Before treating the explant culture with HO1-inhibitory drugs, the culture medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2% FBS. The sciatic explants were cultured for 3 days and used for immunostaining analysis or Western blot analysis. Primary Schwann cells were isolated from the sciatic nerves of adult rats as we previously described (Shin et\\u00a0al., 2012). Briefly, the extracted sciatic nerves were digested by collagenase (2\\u2009mg/mL) in calcium/magnesium-free Hank\\u2019s buffered solution at 37\\u00b0C for 20 min, and then, the nerves were treated with 0.05% trypsin at 37\\u00b0C for 10 min. The chemically digested nerves were dissociated into cell pellets using a flame-polished Pasteur pipette. To increase the Schwann cell population, cells were kept in DMEM containing 1% FBS, Nrg1 (30 ng/mL), and forskolin (5\\u2009\\u03bcM) for 2 to 4 generations. For CO staining, CO-specific fluorescent probes (Michel et\\u00a0al., 2012) were concentration dependently (0, 0.1, 1, and 10\\u2009\\u03bcM) added to the primary Schwann cells without Nrg1 treatment and then left for 30\\u2009min. To verify morphologically the degree of myelin fragmentation during Wallerian degeneration, we used ovoid index and myelin index. Calculating myelin-related indices was performed as described previously (Jung et\\u00a0al., 2011a; Park et\\u00a0al., 2015). Ovoid index is the number of myelin ovoids within 200 \\u03bcm of a teased nerve fiber under a differential interference contrast (DIC)-filtered microscope. In a bar graph, Index 1 is equivalent to one ovoid on a teased nerve fiber. Myelin index shows the number of nerve fibers which contain intact myelin sheaths with longer than 50 \\u03bcm among 100 teased nerve fibers under a microscopic field. In a graph, Index 1 is equivalent to one nerve fiber including 50-\\u00b5m-long intact myelin. Based on our experimental experience, we established a standard (size of ovoid\\u2009=\\u2009200 \\u03bcm; length of double lines of MBP stain\\u2009=\\u200950 \\u00b5m). For immunostaining, primary Schwann cells, frozen nerve sections, and teased nerve fibers were prepared. First, to obtain teased nerve fibers, ex vivo, in vivo sciatic nerve segments were incubated for 1 day in 4% para-formaldehyde at 4\\u00b0C. The nerve sheath was removed, and the segments were separated into one single fiber using fine forceps. Primary Schwann cells, teased nerve fibers, and frozen nerve sections on slides were postfixed in 4% para-formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature (RT). The sample slides were blocked by preincubation with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at RT for 1 hr. The slides were incubated with primary antibodies in PBS overnight at 4\\u00b0C and then with secondary antibodies in PBS for 2 hr at RT. To identify the nucleus of the cells, the slides were counterstained with 4\\u20196-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The immunostained slides were analyzed using a laser confocal microscope (LSM710, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For quantitative analysis, we used Zeiss ZEN digital imaging software (RRID:SCR_013672) accompanied by the LSM 710 microscopy set by same detector gain, amplifier offset, and amplifier gain under a constant laser power in every set of the experiments. The intensity was calculated in randomly selected five 300\\u2009\\u00d7\\u2009300 \\u03bcm2 areas from each section using 10 sections from one group which contains at least 3 rats. The quantification of the relative intensity was carried out by counting the relative number of the pixels showing each intensity unit. To quantify mRNA levels, total mRNA was prepared using the acid guanidine thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extract method (Park et\\u00a0al., 2015). Three micrograms of mRNA were used for cDNA synthesis using SuperScriptII (Invitrogen, Calsbad, CA, USA). Then, cDNA served as the template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using following primers: HO1-F, 5\\u2032-AGCATGTCCCAGGATTTGTC-3\\u2032; HO1-R, 5\\u2032-ACCAGCAGCTCAGGATGAGT-3\\u2032; HO2-F, 5\\u2032-GCAATTCAAGCAGTTCTACC-3\\u2032; HO2-R, 5\\u2032-TGTAGTACCAGGCCAAGAGT-3\\u2032; Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)-F, 5\\u2032-CTACATGGTCTACATGTTCCAGTATG-3\\u2032; GAPDH-R, 5\\u2032-AGTTGTCATGGATGACCTTGG-3\\u2032. Real-time PCR reactions were conducted by 1 \\u03bcL of cDNA as template, 5\\u2009\\u03bcL of SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK), and 10 pmol of each primers. PCR amplifications were conducted using TP700 (Takara Bio Inc, Kusatsu, Japan). Next, to visualize mRNA levels, semiquantitative PCR reactions was conducted in 25 to 33 cycles for GAPDH, HO1, and HO2, and then, gel electrophoresis was performed to confirm the correct size of the amplified cDNA and the absence of nonspecific bands. The extracted in vivo sciatic nerves were resuspended in a modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer\\u201450\\u2009mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150\\u2009mM NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1\\u2009mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1\\u2009mM sodium o\\u2013vanadate, 1\\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Nutley, NJ, USA)]\\u2014boiled for 5 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 g at 4\\u00b0C. The supernatants were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Blots were then blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with the appropriate antibodies (HRPs, RRID:AB_330924, 2099233). Blots were developed an enhanced chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) and band intensity was quantified from X-ray films using the scanner and analyzed with the luminescence image analysis system (RRID:SCR_014299; Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Data were collected randomly and tested in a blinded manner. All statistical analyses were conducted on at least four independent experiments. All of the analyses (one-way ANOVA multiple comparison test) were performed using SPSS 21.0 software (RRID:SCR_002865; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Statistical details are reported in each result and figure legend. After peripheral nerve injury, oxidative events become the main causes of peripheral nerve degeneration (Valek et\\u00a0al., 2015; Lv et\\u00a0al., 2018). Thus, HOs, major proteins that arise as a result of oxidative events, likely have important roles during nerve degeneration and regeneration in the PNS. To determine which HOs affect peripheral nerve degeneration and regeneration, we first examined HO1 and HO2 mRNA expression levels by quantitative reverse transcription PCR in vivo using a sciatic nerve crush model. At 3 days after nerve injury, HO1 mRNA was highly expressed in sciatic nerve and its expression decreased during nerve regeneration (Figure 1(a)). In contrast, HO2 mRNA did not show altered expression (Figure 1(a)). To visualize the mRNA expression patterns of HO1 and HO2 in the sciatic nerve, we performed semiquantitative PCR using HO1, HO2, and GAPDH primers. Semiquantitative PCR revealed an increase in HO1 mRNA during nerve degeneration and a decrease during nerve regeneration (Figure 1(b)). Quantitative analysis (Figure 1(b)) revealed a peak increase in the HO1 mRNA level at 3 days after nerve injury, although no alteration in the HO2 mRNA level was observed during either whole-nerve degeneration or regeneration (Figure 1(c)). Expression patterns of HO mRNA during peripheral nerve degeneration and regeneration. (a) HO1 and HO2 mRNA levels were estimated by quantitative PCR using in vivo sciatic nerves during 1 month after nerve crush (n\\u2009=\\u20096). *P\\u2009<\\u20090.01, **P\\u2009<\\u20090.001, ***P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001. (b) HO1 and HO2 mRNA levels were visually confirmed by semiquantitative PCR using in vivo sciatic nerves during 1 month after nerve crush. (c) Quantitative analyses show relative intensities of HO1 and HO2 mRNA expressions of (b). *P\\u2009<\\u20090.01, ***P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001. HO\\u2009=\\u2009heme oxygenase; GAPDH = glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; loading control; Con = control (uninjured sciatic nerve). Next, we identified the protein expression patterns of HO1 and HO2 in vivo using a sciatic nerve crush model. Similar to the mRNA expression patterns of HO1 and HO2, Western blot analysis showed that HO1 was highly expressed at 3 days after nerve injury and decreased during nerve regeneration (Figure 2(a) and (b)). After completion of nerve regeneration, HO1 protein level returned to the level of the control (Figure 2(a) and (b)). In addition, immunolabeling for HO1 with in vivo-teased sciatic nerve fiber samples showed that HO1 was highly expressed during nerve degeneration and the expression ceased during nerve regeneration, similar to the control (Figure 2(c) and (d)). Conversely, HO2 was continuously expressed in the sciatic nerve regardless of the condition. At 3 days after nerve injury, HO1 was expressed around the ovoid-like structures, not in their core (Figure 2(c)). Taken together, our results imply that, after nerve crush, HO1, not HO2, is the main enzyme that oxidizes cellular heme in the peripheral nerve and is likely involved in oxidative events during Wallerian degeneration. Expression patterns of HO protein during peripheral nerve degeneration and regeneration. (a) HO1 and HO2 protein levels were estimated by Western blot analysis using in vivo sciatic nerves during 1 month after nerve crush (n\\u2009=\\u20096). (b) Quantitative analyses show relative intensities of HO1 and HO2 protein expression of (a). **P\\u2009<\\u20090.001. (c) HO1 and HO2 protein levels were estimated by immunostaining with anti-S100 (green) as a marker of Schwann cells, anti-HO1 (red) and anti-HO2 (red) using in vivo-teased sciatic nerve fibers after nerve crush (n\\u2009=\\u20094 rats). Size bar\\u2009=\\u200950\\u2009\\u03bcm. (d) Quantitative analyses show relative intensities of HO1 and HO2 protein expression with confocal images of (c). *P\\u2009<\\u20090.01. HO\\u2009=\\u2009heme oxygenase; Con\\u2009=\\u2009control (uninjured sciatic nerve). Studies have used Western blot analysis of a cancer cell line and in vivo immunolabeling to show that HO1 is expressed in Schwann cells, albeit without comparison to other structures in peripheral nervous tissue (Hirata et\\u00a0al., 2000; Yama et\\u00a0al., 2016). To identify the exact location of HO1 activation in peripheral nervous tissue during Wallerian degeneration, we performed immunolabeling with S100 (a marker of Schwann cells) and (a marker of axons) antibodies. In the sciatic nerve cross-sections, HO1 immunostaining was highly increased at 3 days after nerve injury and highly overlapped with S100, but not NF, immunostaining (Figure 3(a)). S100/HO1 or NF/HO1 double-positive cell counts also showed that HO1 activation occurred in the S100 immunostained area (Figure 3(b)). Although HO1 was not expressed in the whole Schwann cell, it was partially expressed around ovoid-like myelin fragments, a phenomenon of myelin breakage during Wallerian degeneration (arrowhead, Figure 3(c)). These results indicate that HO1 is highly expressed in denervated Schwann cells, not peripheral axons, and is located in the cytoplasm of Schwann cells excluding the degrading myelin sheath. Denervated Schwann cells highly express HO1 during Wallerian degeneration. (a) Cross sections of in vivo sciatic nerves at 3 days after axotomy were immunostained with HO1 (red) and NF or S100 (green). Size bar\\u2009=\\u200950 \\u03bcm. (b) Cell counts of (a) show the numbers of HO1/S100 or HO1/NF double-positive cells under a microscopic field (300\\u2009\\u00d7\\u2009300 \\u03bcm). ***P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001. n\\u2009=\\u20094 rats. (c) Immunostaining of in vivo-teased sciatic nerve fibers at 3 days after axotomy confirmed the overlapping between HO1 (red) and S100 (green) around ovoid-like structure.

In mammalian cells, HO1 cleaves the heme ring to form biliverdin, CO, and ferrous iron. Thus, if HO1 is highly expressed in denervated Schwann cells, CO, a product of HO1, should also be highly expressed in denervated Schwann cells. To examine CO expression in denervated Schwann cells, we performed gaseous CO staining in a primary Schwann cell culture instead of in vivo Schwann cells, because in culture, Schwann cells are separated from axons and become denervated or enter into a dedifferentiated state. For CO staining in Schwann cells, we used a palladium-mediated fluorescent probe for CO-specific selection in living cells (Michel et\\u00a0al., 2012). In the primary Schwann cell culture, CO staining increased in a dose-dependent manner and was located in the cytoplasm, not the nucleus (Figure 4(a) and (b)). These results indicate that CO is highly expressed in denervated Schwann cells. Thus, CO, one of by-products of HO1 activation, is likely important in Schwann cell dynamics during Wallerian degeneration. Carbon monoxide (CO) is highly expressed in primary Schwann cells. (a) CO-specific fluorescent probe (green) staining shows dose-dependent CO expression in primary Schwann cell culture. Size bar\\u2009=\\u200920 \\u03bcm. (b) Quantitative analysis of (a) shows relative intensity of CO-specific fluorescent probe staining (n\\u2009=\\u20093 rats). **P\\u2009<\\u20090.001. DIC\\u2009=\\u2009differential interference contrast; Con\\u2009=\\u20090\\u2009\\u03bcM probe. To identify the oxidative stress-mediated function of HO1 in Schwann cells during Wallerian degeneration, we screened several drugs that inhibit HO1 activation to abolish the function of HO1 in denervated Schwann cells. For the screening, we used an ex vivo sciatic nerve explant culture system as described previously (Park et\\u00a0al., 2015). Based on the notion that the transverse stripe of the sciatic nerve disappears during Wallerian degeneration, we screened six drugs that inhibit HO1 activation: calmidazolium chloride (1\\u2009mM), lysophosphatidic acid (1\\u2009mM), zinc protoporphyrin (2, 20, and 200\\u2009\\u03bcM), chromium mesoporphyrin (CrMP, 50 and 500\\u2009\\u03bcM), tin mesoporphyrin (SnMP, 10\\u2009\\u03bcM and 1\\u2009mM), and tin protoporphyrin (SnPP, 10 and 100\\u2009\\u03bcM) (Vreman et\\u00a0al., 1993; Wagner et\\u00a0al., 2000; Koeppen and Dickson, 2002; Boehning et\\u00a0al., 2004; Nowis et\\u00a0al., 2008; Xie et\\u00a0al., 2014). Of the HO1-inhibitory drugs, CrMP (50\\u2009\\u03bcM), SnMP (1\\u2009mM), and SnPP (10\\u2009\\u03bcM) strongly inhibited the disappearance of transverse stripes at 3 days in vitro (3DIV) during Wallerian degeneration ex vivo (Figure 5(a)). Quantitative analysis also showed the inhibitory effects of CrMP (50\\u2009\\u03bcM), SnMP (1\\u2009mM), and SnPP (10\\u2009\\u03bcM) on Wallerian degeneration (Figure 5(b)). In addition, we investigated whether three drugs suppress oxidative stress during Wallerian degeneration using nitric oxide synthases (NOS1 and NOS2) as markers of nitrogen-free radical species. Western blot analysis showed that NOS1 was highly expressed on 3DIV (Figure 5(c)). By contrast, CrMP, SnMP, and SnPP treatments inhibited the increases in NOS1 on 3DIV, with levels similar to the control (Figure 5(c)). These inhibitory effects of three drugs mean that HOs activation regulates oxidative stress during Wallerian degeneration. Interestingly, NOS2 protein expression was not found in the Western blot analysis (data not shown) because NOS2 is not present in sciatic nerves (Kikuchi et\\u00a0al., 2018). These three drugs also inhibited HO2 on 3DIV because CrMP, SnMP, and SnPP by competing with heme for binding HOs suppress both HO1 and HO2 (Figure 5(c)). These three drugs effectively suppressed CO expression via HO1 activation in the primary Schwann cell culture (Figure 5(d)). These three inhibitory drugs (CrMP, SnMP, and SnPP) also effectively inhibited HO1 activation up to CO expression against oxidative stress. Thus, our results imply that HO1 activation regulates Wallerian degeneration in Schwann cells against oxidative stress. To assess the detailed subfunctions of HO1 in Schwann cells further, we used three drugs: CrMP (50\\u2009\\u03bcM), SnMP (1\\u2009mM), and SnPP (10\\u2009\\u03bcM). Inhibition of HO1 activation protects against demyelination.

Next, to identify whether HO1 affects myelin fragmentation process, a phenomenon of Wallerian degeneration, we performed morphometric approaches using DIC microscopic analysis of Schwann cells and immunolabeling with MBP (a marker of the myelin sheath) antibody in ex vivo-teased sciatic fibers. Because myelin fragmentation process takes on an ovoid-like shape which appears on the surface of sciatic nerve fibers (Jung et\\u00a0al. 2011a; Park et\\u00a0al. 2015). DIC microscopic analysis revealed that the inhibition of HO1 activation in ex vivo sciatic nerve suppressed the appearance of ovoid-like myelin fragments at 3DIV, similar to the control (arrows) (Figure 6(a)). Morphometric analysis of ovoid formation showed that CrMP, SnMP, and SnPP effectively reduced the number of ovoids at 3DIV in the teased nerve fibers (Figure 6(b)). In addition, confocal microscopy revealed consecutive MBP-immunostained double lines in both margins of control sciatic nerve (Figure 6(c)). In contrast, at 3DIV, the continuity of MBP immunostaining was broken down and was located mainly in the ovoid core; however, inhibition of HO1 maintained intact lines, similar to the control (Figure 6(c)). Quantitative analysis also revealed significant suppression of the breakage of myelin sheath double lines (Figure 6(d)). Thus, these results indicate that oxidative stress-mediated HO1 activation affects myelin fragmentation process during Wallerian degeneration. Inhibition of HO1 activation in Schwann cells preserves myelin sheaths in injured peripheral nerves. (a) Images of teased nerve fibers at 3DIV show ovoid-like myelin fragmentations.

CrMP\\u2009=\\u2009chromium mesoporphyrin; SnMP\\u2009=\\u2009tin mesoporphyrin; SnPP\\u2009=\\u2009tin protoporphyrin; ZnPP\\u2009=\\u2009zinc protoporphyrin; DIC\\u2009=\\u2009differential interference contrast; MBP\\u2009=\\u2009myelin basic protein; Con\\u2009=\\u2009control (uninjured sciatic nerve); 3DIV\\u2009=\\u20093 days in vitro. During Wallerian degeneration, Schwann cells are recharacterized to be similar, but not identical, to developmental Schwann cells. These specific Schwann cells that arise during Wallerian degeneration are known as transdedifferentiated or repair Schwann cells (Jessen and Mirsky, 2016). To determine whether HO1 activation is related to Schwann cell transdedifferentiation, we performed immunolabeling with Schwann cell transdedifferentiation markers, LAMP1 and p75 antibodies (Jung et\\u00a0al., 2011b). Confocal microscopy showed that at 3DIV, the intensities of LAMP1 and p75 immunostaining were highly increased compared with the control. In contrast, inhibition of HO1 activation suppressed LAMP1 and p75 expression at 3DIV (Figure 7(a)). Quantitative analysis revealed that CrMP, SnMP, and SnPP effectively inhibited the expression of LAMP1 and p75 in the ex vivo sciatic nerve fibers (Figure 7(b)). Thus, these results suggest that HO1 leads to Schwann cell transdedifferentiation during Wallerian degeneration ex vivo. Inhibition of HO1 activation in Schwann cells regulates Schwann cell transdedifferentiation ex vivo. (a) Confocal images show immunolabeling for S100 (green) with LAMP1 (red) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75, red) as markers of Schwann cell transdedifferentiation using teased sciatic nerve fibers.

The proliferation of Schwann cells is another feature of note in Wallerian degeneration. To determine whether HO1 activation affects Schwann cell proliferation during Wallerian degeneration, we performed immunolabeling with a cell proliferation marker, Ki67 antibody. Confocal microscopy showed that at 3DIV, Ki67 immunostaining highly overlapped with DAPI staining (Figure 8(a)). In contrast, HO1-inhibitory drugs suppressed the induction of Ki67 in Schwann cells (Figure 8(a)). Quantitative cell counts also showed that at 3DIV, inhibition of HO1 activation abolished the induction of Ki67 in Schwann cells (Figure 8(b)). Thus, these results indicate that HO1 leads to Schwann cell proliferation during Wallerian degeneration ex vivo.

To confirm the relevance of HO1 on Wallerian degeneration, we performed morphometric analyses using the stripe, ovoid, myelin, and NF indices in in vivo model. We used a 10-mm blind PVC tube packed with gel foam presoaked in CrMP (50\\u2009\\u03bcM, 500\\u2009\\u03bcM, and 5\\u2009mM), SnMP (100\\u2009\\u03bcM, 1\\u2009mM, and 10\\u2009mM) and SnPP (10\\u2009\\u03bcM, 100\\u2009\\u03bcM, and 1\\u2009mM) to treat the distal stumps of axotomized sciatic nerves for 3 days (Park et\\u00a0al. 2015). In in vivo sciatic nerves treated with HO inhibitors for 3 days after axotomy, 5\\u2009mM CrMP, 10\\u2009mM SnMP, and 1\\u2009mM SnPP were most effective doses for inhibition of transverse stripes (Figure 9(a)). HO inhibitors also inhibited myelin fragmentation process during Wallerian degeneration in vivo after 3 days based on the number of ovoid fragments and MBP immunostaining (Figure 9(b) to (d)). Next, we analyzed quantitatively the degree of axon preservation in vivo during Wallerian degeneration, using NF immunostaining after treatment of HO inhibitors (Figure 9(e)). Three HO inhibitors also suppressed the disappearance of consecutive NF-positive line structures in sciatic nerve fibers on 3DIV. Thus, we found that in vivo treatment with HO inhibitors effectively inhibited myelin fragmentation process and axonal degradation, suggesting that HO1 regulates Wallerian degeneration in vivo. Inhibition of HO1 activation in in vivo animal model after nerve axotomy suppresses phenotypes of Wallerian degeneration in sciatic nerves.

HOs are mediators of oxidative injury and cellular stress in living cells and affect cellular redox homeostasis. Compared to the central nervous system, the roles of HOs in the PNS remain unknown. Hirata et\\u00a0al. (2000) reported high HO1 activation in myelin-phagocytosing Schwann cells in in vivo-injured sciatic nerves, and Yama et\\u00a0al. (2016) reported that upregulation of HO1 in vitro exerted neuroprotective effects. However, these studies did not determine which type of HOs was important in the PNS and which cell type (e.g., peripheral axons or Schwann cells) expressed HOs under specific conditions. In addition, the authors did not describe the detailed functions of HOs during Wallerian degeneration. When we first examined the distribution of HO1 and HO2 activation in peripheral nerves, we found that HO2 was always expressed in peripheral nerves with or without nerve injury (Figures 1 and 2). This finding indicates that in the PNS, HO2 likely acts to maintain normal levels of CO and ferrous iron as a way of surviving in living cells. In contrast, the activation of HO1 differed from that of HO2 in peripheral nerves. HO1 was highly expressed in denervated Schwann cells during Wallerian degeneration and decreased in reinnervated Schwann cells during nerve regeneration (Figures 1 and 2). These results are similar to those reported by Hirata et\\u00a0al. (2000), but are not consistent with those of Yama et\\u00a0al. (2016). According to Yama et\\u00a0al. (2016), epalrestat induced HO1 activation in Schwann-cell-related cells but did not promote induction of ferrous iron and reactive oxygen species. These results imply that epalrestat may exert an inhibitory effect on ferrous iron and reactive oxygen species, but not a direct effect on HO1. The increase in HO1 activation in Schwann-cell-related cells via epalrestat may compensate for the lack of ferrous iron in living cells. Thus, in peripheral nerves, HO1 may be upregulated when the nerve is damaged by oxidative injury. On the other hands, because oxidative stress affects peripheral axon degeneration (Bros et\\u00a0al., 2014), we hypothesized that HO1 would be expressed in both injured Schwann cells and peripheral axons. However, HO1 was expressed only in Schwann cells, not in degenerating axons (Figure 3). These results indicate that in the peripheral nerve, the response to oxidative damage differs between Schwann cells and axons. In Schwann cells, after nerve injury, HO1 activation was highly upregulated 3 days (peak increase) during Wallerian degeneration, decreased during nerve regeneration, and ultimately disappeared, similar to the control. HO1 degrades heme into equimolar amounts of biliverdin, CO, and ferrous iron. Based on these products, HO1 exerts two contradictory antioxidant and prooxidant functions. Biliverdin and CO act as antioxidants and mediate cytoprotective effects (Ryter et\\u00a0al., 2006). In brain neurodegenerative diseases, HO1 plays a neuroprotective role against oxidative stress (Chen et\\u00a0al., 2000; Chen, 2014). In contrast, HO1 induction is associated with adverse effects in several diseases (Schipper et\\u00a0al., 2009). For example, chronic activation of HO1 leads to pathological iron deposition in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\\u2019s and Parkinson\\u2019s, and induces irreversible neurological brain damage (Schipper and Song, 2015) In peripheral nerves, the molecular mechanism of neurodegeneration associated with HO1-mediated oxidative events remains unclear. Our data imply that inhibition of HO1 suppresses peripheral nerve degeneration (Figures 5, 6 and 9) and important phenotypes of Wallerian degeneration, such as Schwann cell transdedifferentiation and proliferation (Figures 7 and 8). This functional inhibition of HO1 activation helps to explain the role of HO1 in specially denervated Schwann cells during Wallerian degeneration: Its prooxidant effect, rather than its antioxidant effect, tends to induce peripheral nerve degeneration (prooxidant effect\\u2009>\\u2009antioxidant effect). It was previously reported that transferrin, an iron carrier protein, is upregulated in Schwann cells after nerve injury (Hirata et\\u00a0al., 2000; Salis et al., 2007). These results support our hypothesis that after nerve injury, the prooxidant effect by iron deposition in Schwann cells is the main function of HO1 overexpression in Wallerian degeneration. During Wallerian degeneration, peripheral nerves morphologically show two appearances: (i) axon degradation and (ii) demyelination. Axons can be broken down either directly via neuronal cellular mechanisms (Fischer et\\u00a0al., 2012; Bros et\\u00a0al., 2014) or indirectly by mechanical force from Schwann cells (Jung et\\u00a0al., 2011a). However, it appears that oxidative stress-mediated HO1 activation is not related to axonal degradation during Wallerian degeneration because HO1 is not expressed in peripheral axons (Figure 3). This result indicates that HO1 in Schwann cell dynamics is more important than peripheral axons during Wallerian degeneration. Previous studies have shown that Schwann cell demyelination is regulated by the MAPK pathway (Parkinson et\\u00a0al., 2008; Yang et\\u00a0al., 2012), and our results indicate that HO1 inhibition in Schwann cells suppresses myelin fragmentation process (Figures 5 and 6). These results indicate that the inhibition of demyelination by HO1 inhibitory drug treatment in sciatic nerve explant cultures may be because CO, a product of HO1, acts as a cell signaling molecule which affects the increase in c-jun and p38 MAPK expression in Schwann cells (Lee and Chau, 2002; Morse et\\u00a0al., 2003). Interestingly, in Figures 5 and 6, each HO inhibitor showed different HO-inhibitory effect and inhibited incompletely ovoid formation. Almost HO inhibitors compete with heme to suppress HO activation in living cells (Vreman et\\u00a0al., 1993; Wagner et\\u00a0al., 2000; Koeppen and Dickson, 2002; Boehning et\\u00a0al., 2004; Nowis et\\u00a0al., 2008; Xie et\\u00a0al., 2014). HO inhibitors contain a ring structure which binds to iron and competes with heme protein for binding to iron. However, because this structure is little bit bulky and each inhibitor contains a different positive metal ion in the core of a ring, they have different chemical characteristics, such as permeability, solubility and stability. In addition, because sciatic nerves consist of three-layered connective membranes (epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium), it is not easy for the inhibitors to penetrate into Schwann cells effectively. Thus, these may be main reasons why all inhibitors could show different drug effects on ex vivo sciatic nerve explants and inhibit incompletely the nerve degeneration. In addition, oxidative stress in Schwann cells can modify lipid profiles and induce myelin disruption during Wallerian degeneration (Hichor et\\u00a0al., 2017, 2018). Thus, the induction of demyelination during Wallerian degeneration may be because overproduction of ferrous iron, a by-product of HO1, deteriorates oxidative conditions in Schwann cells and induces demyelination or prompts demyelination in Schwann cells. To visualize clearly the effect of HO1 activation on demyelination, further evaluation, such as analysis of semithin or ultrathin sections, should be necessary. During Wallerian degeneration, Schwann cells undergo recharacterization to become similar, but not identical, to developmental Schwann cells. The state of the recharacterized Schwann cell is called transdedifferentiation, and such Schwann cells are known as dedifferentiated or repair Schwann cells (Jessen and Mirsky 2016). Thus, Schwann cell transdedifferentiation is a phenotype of Wallerian degeneration in the PNS. The suppression of Schwann cell transdedifferentiation by HO1 inhibition observed in this study demonstrates that HO1 activation regulates the expression of transdedifferentiation-related molecules at the intracellular level in Schwann cells (Figure 7). It was previously reported that oxidative stress induced p75NTR expression, leading to neurodegeneration (Shin et\\u00a0al., 2011; Kraemer et\\u00a0al., 2014), and lysosomal expression, leading to apoptotic cell death (Kurz et\\u00a0al., 2008; Yoon et\\u00a0al., 2011). Thus, p75NTR and lysosomal expression can be used as molecular markers for oxidative stress-mediated Schwann cell transdedifferentiation (Jung et\\u00a0al., 2011b). Our data also indicate that HO1 inhibition suppresses induction of both p75NTR and LAMP1 (a lysosomal protein) (Figure 7), implying that the decreased prooxidant effects of HO1 inhibition suppress induction of p75NTR and lysosomal expression in Schwann cells during Wallerian degeneration. Finally, HO1-expressing cells show uncontrolled proliferation and progress toward carcinogenesis and metastasis (Nitti et\\u00a0al., 2017). Denervated Schwann cells also share features with cancer cells, such as cell proliferation and epithelial\\u2013mesenchymal transition. In our study, during Wallerian degeneration, Schwann cells underwent proliferation, while HO1 inhibition suppressed Schwann cell proliferation (Figure 8). These results imply that oxidative events induced by HO1 activation in denervated Schwann cells influence Schwann cell proliferation during Wallerian degeneration. In conclusion, our results demonstrated pathophysiological roles of HO1 that regulate myelin fragmentation process, axonal degradation, Schwann cell transdedifferentiation, and proliferation during Wallerian degeneration. In addition, we identified that HO regulates for the first time CO expression in Schwann cells using synthetic CO-specific probe morphologically. Thus, we define HO1/CO as new regulators in Schwann cells during Wallerian degeneration.\", \"metadata\": {\"paper_id\": \"6498775\", \"authors\": \"Kim Muwoong, Kim Hyosun, Kim Dogyeong, Kim Dokyoung, Huh Youngbuhm, Park Chan, Chung Hyung-Joo, Jung Junyang, Jeong Na Young\", \"year\": \"2019\", \"journal\": \"ASN NEURO\"}}, {\"content\": \"Title: Axonal Protection by Tacrolimus with Inhibition of NFATc1 in TNF-Induced Optic Nerve Degeneration\\n\\nAbstract: Tacrolimus, a calcineurin (CaN) inhibitor, has been used for treatment of refractory allergic ocular disease, although its role in optic nerve degeneration remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether tacrolimus modulates tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated axonal degeneration and whether it alters nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc), a downstream effector of CaN signaling. Immunoblot analysis showed no significant difference in CaNA\\u03b1 protein levels in optic nerve on day 3, 7, or 14 after TNF injection compared with PBS injection. However, a significant increase in NFATc1 protein level was observed in optic nerve 7\\u00a0days after TNF injection. This increase was negated by simultaneous administration of tacrolimus. Administration of tacrolimus alone did not change the NFATc1 protein level in comparison to that observed after PBS injection. A significant increase in TNF protein level was observed in optic nerve 14\\u00a0days after TNF injection and this increase was prevented by tacrolimus. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the immunoreactivity of NFATc1 to be increased in optic nerve after TNF injection. This increased immunoreactivity was colocalized with glial fibrillary acidic protein and was suppressed by tacrolimus. Treatment of tacrolimus significantly ameliorated the TNF-mediated axonal loss. These results suggest that tacrolimus is neuroprotective against axon loss in TNF-induced optic neuropathy and that the effect arises from suppression of the CaN/NFATc1 pathway.

It is characterized by a slowly progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) pathology in which axonal degeneration of RGCs in the optic nerve precedes death of the RGC body. The only reliable clinical treatment for glaucoma is lowering intraocular pressure. However, means of neuroprotection are being studied as a complementary treatments. Calcineurin (CaN) is a serine/threonine phosphatase, dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM). It is composed of two subunits, CaNA and CaNB. CaNA which has a CaM-binding domain, acts as a 60-kDa catalytic subunit. CaNB, a 19-kDa regulatory subunit, has a Ca2+-binding domain [1, 2]. There are three isoforms (\\u03b1, \\u03b2, \\u03b3) of CaNA, with CaNA\\u03b3 expression limited to testis and CaNA\\u03b1 and CaNA\\u03b2 expressed in all tissues, but in varying ratios. In brain, for example, CaNA\\u03b1 is more abundant than CaNA\\u03b2 in brain [3, 4]. Increased intracellular Ca2+ activates CaN, and the CaN combines with the Ca2+/CaM, leading to dephosphorylation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc) in the cytoplasm. Dephosphorylated NFATc translocates to the nucleus to regulate the transcription of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [5, 6]. There are 4 Ca2+/CaM-dependent NFATc transcription factors: NFATc1 (NFAT2), NFATc2 (NFAT1), NFATc3 (NFAT4), and NFATc4 (NFAT3) [7]. All are expressed in human brain, with NFATc1 reported to be present in astrocytes [8]. Increased NFATc1 activity has been observed in the cerebral cortex in a rat traumatic brain injury model [9] Tacrolimus, a CaN inhibitor, forms a complex with immunophilin (FKBP) and inhibits CaN enzyme activity [10]. Tacrolimus has been clinically applied as an immunosuppressant and also applied via eyedrops for severe allergic conjunctivitis. In addition, tacrolimus has been shown to have a protective effect on RGCs in an optic nerve crush model [11, 12] and both on RGCs and optic nerve axons in an elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) model [13], although its mechanism remains to be elucidated. TNF is a cytokine that is synthesized and released from microglia and astrocytes around several neurons. An association between TNF-related neurotoxicity and glaucomatous optic neuropathy has been reported [14]. For example, a previous study has shown that ratio of TNF positive patients in aqueous humor was significantly higher in glaucoma group than cataract group [15]. In addition, a study from human glaucomatous retina has shown a significant up-regulation of TNF/TNF receptor 1 signaling [16]. More recently, a TNF antagonist was shown to reduce RGC hyperexcitability in a rat hypertensive glaucoma model [17]. We previously reported that intravitreal injection of TNF induces optic nerve degeneration in rats, in turn inducing RGC loss in rats [18]. In the present study, we tested whether tacrolimus modulates TNF-mediated axonal loss and it alters CaN/NFATc1 signaling. For experiments, male Wistar rats of 50 to 55\\u00a0days old were used. All experiments were conducted in accordance with statements of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology statement on the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Animals were kept in a controlled condition with a temperature of 23\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091\\u00a0\\u00b0C, humidity of 55\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20095%, and light between 6 am and 6\\u00a0pm. Intravitreal injection of TNF (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) or tacrolimus (Senju pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan) was performed as previously described [19]. Briefly, intramuscular injection anesthesia with mixture of ketamine-xylazine (10\\u00a0mg/kg and 4\\u00a0mg/kg respectively) was administered to rats. A single 2-\\u03bcL injection of 10\\u00a0ng TNF in 0.01\\u00a0M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7. 40) was administered intravitreally into the animal\\u2019s right eye under a microscope. PBS alone, as a control, was administered to the left eye. Three, seven or fourteen days after the intravitreal injections, the rats were killed by an overdose of sodium pentobarbital administered intraperitoneally, and the eyes were subsequently enucleated. One hundred and two rats were used for immunoblot analysis as described previously [19]. Briefly, optic nerves (4\\u00a0mm in length) and retinas were collected, homogenized, and centrifuged at 15,000\\u00d7g for 15\\u00a0min at 4\\u00a0\\u00b0C after 3, 7 or 14\\u00a0days after the intravitreal injections. Optic nerve specimens (n\\u2009=\\u20092) were collected for each sample. Each retina was used as one sample. Protein concentrations were measured with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Protein samples (3\\u00a0\\u03bcg per lane of optic nerve sample; 5\\u00a0\\u03bcg per lane of retina) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to an enhanced chemiluminescent membrane (EMD Millipore Corporation, Temecula, CA). Tris buffered saline-0.1% Tween-20 (T-TBS) containing 5% skim milk was used for blocking of membranes. Membranes were reacted with CaNA\\u03b1 antibody (1:200; EMD Millipore Corporation), NFATc1 antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, TX), TNF antibody (1:200; R&D Systems, MN) or anti-\\u03b2-actin antibody (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich) in T-TBS. The membranes were then reacted to peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH), peroxidase-labeled anti-goat secondary antibody (MP Biochemicals) or peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (MP Biochemicals) diluted 1:5000 in T-TBS. Immunoblots were detected by a chemiluminescence membrane detection system (ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagents; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Twelve rats were used for immunohistochemical analysis as described previously [19]. After injection of PBS, TNF or TNF with tacrolimus, eyes were put into 4% paraformaldehyde. After paraffin sections were made, sections were incubated with anti-NFATc1 antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody (1:200; Dako, Tokyo, Japan) or anti ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule1 (Iba-1; a marker of microglial cells) antibody (1:100; WAKO, Osaka, Japan). After washing, the sections were reacted with rhodamine-labeled or FITC-labeled secondary antibodies (1:100; Cappel, Aurora, OH) in the dark. After several washing, the sections were mounted on slides in DAPI-containing medium (Vectashield with DAPI; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). BSA was dropped as a negative control by replacing the primary antibody. Morphometric analysis of each optic nerve in samples from 23 rats was performed as described previously [19]. Two weeks after the intravitreal injections, eyes were obtained from the animals. The optic nerves, 4-mm segments, were obtained from 1\\u00a0mm behind the globe. The segments were soaked in Karnovsky\\u2019s solution for 24\\u00a0h at 4\\u2103, processed and embedded in acrylic resin. Cross Sections (1\\u00a0\\u03bcm thick) were cut and stained with a solution of 1% paraphenylene-diamine (Sigma-Aldrich) in absolute methanol. For each slice, images at the center and at each quadrant of the periphery (approximately 141.4\\u00a0\\u03bcm from the center) were obtained with a light microscope (BX51, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), which was equipped with a 100\\u2009\\u00d7\\u2009coupled digital camera (MP5Mc/OL, Olympus) and QCapture Pro software (version 5.1, QImaging, Surrey, Canada). Aphelion image processing software (Version 3.2, ADCIS, H\\u00e9rouville Saint-Clair, France) quantified the acquired images. The number of axons was calculated in five distinct regions from each eye, 1446.5\\u00a0\\u03bcm2 each (each quadrant in the periphery plus the center; total area of 7232.3\\u00a0\\u03bcm2 per eye). An average of the number of axons per eye was calculated, and this average value was calculated as a number per square millimeter. For each experimental condition at least 5 eyes were used for the analysis. Data are presented as mean\\u2009\\u00b1\\u2009SEM. Differences between groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and then Dunnett\\u2019s test. A probability value (p value) of\\u2009<\\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. Immunoblot analysis showed a band of CaNA\\u03b1 at 58\\u00a0kDa in the optic nerve sample, and no time point did the CaNA\\u03b1 protein level after TNF injection differ from that after PBS injection. No cleaved CaNA\\u03b1 was observed in the optic nerve at any time point after TNF injection (Fig.\\u00a01).Fig. 1CaNA\\u03b1 protein expression in optic nerves on days 3, 7 and 14 after intravitreal injection of PBS or TNF.

This increased immunoreactivity was colocalized with GFAP, a marker of astrocyte (Fig.\\u00a06), and was suppressed by tacrolimus (Fig.\\u00a06). Similar findings were observed in cross sectioned optic nerves. The immunoreactivity of NFATc1 was increased by TNF which is colocalized with GFAP, and this was suppressed by tacrolimus (Fig.\\u00a07).Fig. 6Immunohistochemistry for NFATc1 in longitudinal sectioned optic nerves.

Although treatment of 10\\u22126\\u00a0M tacrolimus had a certain axonal protective effect (Fig.\\u00a08c), the neurodegeneration induced by TNF was noticeable.

However, treatment with 10\\u22125\\u00a0M tacrolimus (Fig.\\u00a08d) and 10\\u22124\\u00a0M tacrolimus (Fig.\\u00a08e) yielded substantial axonal protection.

NFATc1 is present in glial cells in optic nerve. Tacrolimus prevented the increase in NFATc1 expression and ameliorated the loss of axons of the optic nerve after TNF injection. These results suggest that the protective effect of tacrolimus may be involved in its inhibitory effect on NFATc1 expression. In a previously reported study, cleaved CaN was found in retinal protein in the rat IOP elevation model but not in retinal protein in the optic nerve crush model [13]. In our current study, cleaved CaN was not observed in retinal protein (Supplementary Fig. 1) or in optic nerve protein (Fig.\\u00a01) after TNF injection. Under physiological elevation of intracellular Ca2+, CaNA activity is reversible. However, under a pathophysiological condition such as kainate- or glutamate-induced excitotoxicity [2] or cerebral ischemia [20], which causes excessive intracellular Ca2+ influx, CaNA activity is lasting. Calpain, a Ca/CaM dependent protein, puts CaN into a constitutively activated state by cleaving the self-suppressing region of CaNA [2]. However, it is unclear why only IOP elevation caused cleavage of CaN but that optic nerve crush and TNF injection model did not. One hypothesis posits that the increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration is limited in the TNF model and that the increase is not enough to occur CaN cleavage or alter the CaN protein level. Nonetheless, we cannot deny the possibility of CaN activation in the TNF model because lack of agreement between the protein levels and the enzyme activity of CaN has been reported [21]. Recent studies have reported NFATc3 expression in human lamina cribrosa cells [22] and NFATc1 expression in human trabecular meshwork cells [23]. Our study appears to be the first to reveal expression of NFATc1 in optic nerve. The protein levels of NFATc1 in optic nerve increased with TNF-induced optic nerve degeneration. Increased expression of NFAT4 has been reported in activated astrocytes throughout the axon/dendrite layers of CA1 and the dentate gyrus [24]. It has also been reported that in quiescent astrocytes, TNF recruits CaN to stimulate a canonical NFAT pathway [25]. We found NFATc1 immunoreactivity colocalized with GFAP immunoreactivity but not with Iba1 immunoreactivity (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a02), indicating that NFATc1 is present in astrocytes not in microglial cells in optic nerve. It is interesting to note that Ca-channel agonist increases TNF via the CaN/NFAT system in PC12 cells [26]. Therefore, it is possible that increased Ca2+ may result in CaN/NFAT activation, thereby increasing in TNF in certain cell death. Consistent with this idea, the present study demonstrated that increased NFATc1 protein level was observed 7\\u00a0days and increased TNF protein level was observed 14\\u00a0days after TNF injection, suggesting that NFATc1 exists upstream of TNF. It was reported that NFATc1\\u03b2, an isoform of NFATc1, upregulated TNF production in NIH3T3 cells [27]. On the other hand, other possibility is that there are some compensatory effects by the other NFATc proteins, because it was demonstrated that TNF upregulation was the main cause of cell death controlled by NFATc2 in NIH3T3 cells [28]. In the present study, we found that tacrolimus significantly prevented the TNF-induced increase in NFATc1 expression in optic nerve. Morphometric analysis revealed that tacrolimus significantly prevented TNF-induced axon loss. These findings are consistent with those of a previously reported study demonstrating that tacrolimus attenuates the activation of astrocytes and microglia of brain in a rat cerebral ischemia model [29]. That study also demonstrated that tacrolimus attenuates the expression of cytokines, such as TNF-\\u03b1, in glia after cerebral ischemia [29]. The present study also found that tacrolimus abolished increment of TNF protein level in optic nerve. Moreover, it was reported that tacrolimus abolished NFAT activation in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus neurons of mice [30]. Furthermore, it was shown that increased expression of NFAT4 in activated astrocytes was observed in hippocampus of a murine Alzheimer's disease model [31] and that amyloid \\u03b2 expression in hippocampus was suppressed by administration of tacrolimus or NFAT inhibitor in the murine Alzheimer's disease model [32]. Thus, inhibition of NFAT by tacrolimus may have beneficial effects against several types of neuronal damages. Similarly to the results of immunoblotting, the present immunohistochemical study showed that the expression of NFATc1 tended to increase after TNF injection, and this increase was suppressed by tacrolimus. Increased expression of GFAP induced by TNF tended to be suppressed by tacrolimus. Intravitreal injection of TNF may lead to activation of microglia and astrocytes in optic nerve [18, 33]. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that tacrolimus suppresses the activation of glial cells and inhibits the positive feedback loop among activated glia, cytokines and CaN/NFAT [34]. In conclusion, tacrolimus may protect against axon loss in TNF-induced optic neuropathy by inhibiting the CaN/NFATc1 pathway.
