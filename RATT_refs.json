It highlights two hypotheses regarding polyQ expansions: neurotoxicity from recruitment of other proteins into aggregates and inhibition of the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system.

We further explored distribution of the various\npolyQ disease-related\nconcepts in the published documents (journals and patents) (Figure 10). PolyQ disease-related\nconcepts explored in the CAS Content Collection,\nassociated with disease, therapy and disease mechanism. Molecular chaperones rang at the top\nof the therapeutic\nstrategies concepts. Molecular chaperones play a key role in maintaining\ncellular proteostasis by facilitating the correct folding of cellular\nproteins to guarantee their function or by advancing the degradation\nof terminally misfolded proteins to prevent damage.234 With advancing age, the capability of this proteostasis\nsupporting network tends to weaken, which facilitates the progression\nof neurodegenerative diseases. In general, two key hypotheses exist\nexplaining for polyQ expansions may trigger cellular dysfunction:\n(i) neurotoxicity stems from the ability of polyQ-expanded proteins\nto recruit other vital cellular proteins into the aggregates; (ii)\naggregating polyQ proteins partly inhibit the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome\nsystem for protein degradation.235 These\ntwo models are not exclusive but may act in concert. Overall, protein\nmisfolding and aggregation are prevented by the machinery of molecular\nchaperones. Some chaperones such as the Hsp70 family members also\nmodify polyQ aggregation and inhibit its toxicity. These results point\nout the functional relationship between molecular chaperones, the\nubiquitin\u2013proteasome system, and polyQ aggregation.235 Chaperone therapy is a recently developed therapeutic\nstrategy against protein misfolding diseases. Molecular chaperones\nutilizing the heat shock protein and other chaperone proteins have\nbeen reported able to handle abnormally accumulated proteins as a\nnew approach to neurodegenerative diseases.236 Understanding how chaperones interrelate to disease progression\nis essential for the advancement of therapeutic strategies to combat\nthese debilitating diseases.234 Disease models constitute another widely explored\nconcept in the polyQ disease-related documents in the CAS Content\nCollection (Figure 10). PolyQ diseases affect neural tissue, which is particularly hard\nto obtain from patients. Therefore, cellular and organism models are\nessential for successful research in this area.

In\nneurodegenerative diseases, histone acetylation homeostasis is significantly\ncompromised, giving rise to hypoacetylation. In particular, it has\nbeen evidenced that the chromatin acetylation status is critically\nimpaired in polyQ disorders. Therefore, histone hyperacetylation triggered\nby inhibition of HDACs has neuroprotective effect and HDAC inhibitors\nhave been suggested as a relevant treatment approach.245 Small molecule inhibitors of HDACs notably\naffect neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth, and thus exhibit\na potential as therapeutic agents for treatment of neurodegenerative\ndiseases including polyQ diseases.246 These\ninhibitors of the zinc-dependent classes of HDACs belong to 4 classes\nregarding their chemical structure: hydroxamates, cyclic peptides,\nshort chain fatty acids and benzamides.247 The clinical application of these broadly acting compounds for neurodegenerative\ndisorders is limited however by their toxicity. Moreover, additional\nstudies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms associated with\nthe beneficial effects of selective HDAC inhibitors, to identify specific\nsubstrates and to further define the pathways in which specific HDAC\nenzymes are involved.

        "summary: The excerpt highlights that gene silencing therapies, such as RNA interference (RNAi) and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) strategies, show promise for polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, particularly in suppressing the mutant huntingtin protein (relevant to Huntington's disease, HD) before its pathogenic effects manifest. Protein aggregation, noted as a key characteristic, is a primary target for therapeutic strategies, including aggregation inhibitors and chaperone-based therapies, which also relate to neuronal cell death and proteostasis. Post-translational modifications, especially phosphorylation, are implicated in the neurotoxicity of the mutant protein, aligning with the mechanisms of neuronal survival and aggregation.\n\n6": {

A rational approach to treating polyQ\ndiseases is to suppress production\nof the mutant protein ahead of its deleterious effects. Therefore,\nsilencing the mutant gene would be of therapeutic benefit. Gene\nsilencing therapies have been developed, using either RNA interference\n(RNAi) or antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) strategies.248 Both have been proven promising in studies\nin animal models of polyQ diseases, including SBMA, SCA1, and HD.249 A number of challenges must be dealt with,\nhowever, before these results can be translated to the clinic. The distribution of documents in the CAS Content Collection related\nto the polyQ disease hallmarks concepts are presented in Figure 11A, while a Sankey\ngraph of the number of documents in which these concepts co-occur\nwith certain disease remedies are shown in Figure 11B. Pathological protein aggregation appears\nas the most widely discussed attribute of the polyQ diseases, it also\nco-occurs in documents related to the majority of therapeutic approaches.\nThis is an anticipated observation since protein aggregation is a\nkey pathological hallmark of the majority of neurodegenerative diseases\nand is in fact related to virtually all other neurodegeneration attributes.\nUnderstandably, it most often co-occurs with the aggregation inhibitors\nas a therapeutic strategy. Chaperone-based therapies also appear as\nclosely targeted to pathological protein aggregation. Neuronal cell\ndeath and the aberrant proteostasis are another polyQ disorder attributes\ndiscussed along with multiple disease remedies (Figure 11B). Proteostasis modulators\nalong with the chaperone-based therapies are most frequently targeted\nto aberrant proteostasis. Neuronal cell death is about equally targeted\nby several therapeutic strategies: aggregation inhibitors, chaperone-based\ntherapies, and cognitive enhancers. Cognitive enhancers seem like\nthe major strategy toward synaptic and neuronal network dysfunction.

Research has revealed that post-translational modifications\nof\nthe polyglutamine proteins are involved in their neurotoxicity and\ncan significantly modulate it. The distribution of documents in the\nCAS Content Collection discussing various types of post-translational\nprotein modifications is presented in Figure 12A, and the co-occurrence of these terms\nwith the various members of the polyQ diseases are shown in Figure 12B. Generally, Huntington\u2019s\ndisease, which is the subject of the largest number of documents in\nthis subset, co-occurs also with the largest number of documents discussing\npost-translational modifications. On the other hand, phosphorylation,\nas the major type of post-translational modification, is related to\nall kinds of polyQ diseases. The largest part of documents discuss\nphosphorylation, in association with Huntington\u2019s disease.\nPalmitoylation only co-occurs with Huntington\u2019s disease-related\ndocuments, while transglutamination\u2013with Huntington\u2019s\ndisease and spinocerebellar ataxias.
